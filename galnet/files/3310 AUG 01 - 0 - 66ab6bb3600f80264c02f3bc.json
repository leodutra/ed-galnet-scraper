It appears that the Thargoids have restarted industrial efforts at these locations.”\n“It’s possible that the aliens have developed a method of cleansing the spires of our sabotage compounds. The spires’ internal functions may have been repurposed by other means. What we know, however, is that further contamination of these sites will be needed to shut them down for good.”\nIn addition, AX fleets on the front line around Titan Thor also confirmed the withdrawal of Thargoid fleets from several unpopulated systems in the area. Madigan noted that Aegis’s ‘special advisor’, Seo Jin-ae, believes the relocation of these forces and the reactivation of these spire sites is not coincidental.\nThe two reactivated spire sites are located in the following systems:\nCol 285 Sector PB-E b12-3\nCol 285 Sector OG-E b12-1","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:39:05Z","deprecated":false}
