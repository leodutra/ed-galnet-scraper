Precise casualty numbers are unavailable, but several hundred thousand people have been killed with many more injured.\nThere are urgent calls for independent pilots to rescue survivors and support repair operations at all nine locations:\nDawes Hub in the Achenar system\nDonaldson in the Alioth system\nDublin Citadel in the Gateway system\nHahn Gateway in the Nanomam system\nIto Orbital in the Rhea system\nLave Station in the Lave system\nLi Qing Jao in the Sol system\nParkinson Dock in the Eotienses system\nShajn Market in the Kamadhenu system\nThe explosive damage to each station is consistent with corrosive enzyme weapons previously used by the NMLA. This has triggered automated systems designed to respond to Thargoid assaults.\nThe Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy are on full alert. Other military and security forces across the core systems are preparing for possible further attacks.\nThe Galactic Summit has been temporarily suspended while Alliance, Empire and Federation leaders respond to the emergency. A full lockdown is in effect in the Sirius system, where the scheduled bounty hunting and trade initiatives have been cancelled."}
