The Thargoids have given us a bloody nose on several occasions. But we are strong, we will heal, and you can help.”\n“We’re asking for pilots to deliver as much as they can fit in their holds. We’re going to rebuild our starports better than ever. Let’s get the Pleiades fighting fit once more.”\nTraders are requested to deliver construction materials to The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector Ir-W D1-55 system.\nThe campaign begins on the 31st of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
