Our aim is to construct a dedicated scientific facility to analyse these incredible lifeforms.”\n“We therefore request quantities of Cobalt, Indium and Tantalum to be delivered to Williams Vision in the Nahuaru system.”\n“In addition, we ask pilots to provide us with exploration data, which will form the core of our xenological research catalogue. Nahuaru Crimson Bridge Int has agreed to fund the initiative and reimburse contributing pilots.”\nThe initiative begins on the 7th of February 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:31:16Z","deprecated":false}
