Nothing could be further from the truth.”\n“It is true that Thargoid vessels typically scan human craft rather than attack, so I can understand how this misconception has taken root, but I assure you it is baseless. Data recovered from IR-W D1-55, including the black box from the Farragut-class Battlecruiser, proves beyond a doubt that the attack was initiated by the Thargoids. To suggest otherwise dishonours the memory of those who lost their lives in this tragedy.”\nA spokesperson for Aegis, which is coordinating research into the Thargoids, confirmed the veracity of Lieutenant Kael’s statement:\n“We have been analysing the data from the attack site in an effort to understand the Thargoids’ motives and military capabilities. While I cannot yet reveal the results of that analysis, I can confirm that the convoy was attacked without provocation by multiple Thargoid vessels.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:00:39Z","deprecated":false}
