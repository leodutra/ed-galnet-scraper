Since then the dredger has become the home for a nomadic tribe called the Scriveners Clan, which refuses contact with all outsiders.\nVice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew told the media:\n“Orion University is willing to reward pilots who can pinpoint the dredger’s current location. We believe it is still within 500 light years of the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system.”\n“Pilots who are interested in helping should first dock at Ring Mine station in the 2MASS J03291977+3124572 system, to automatically sign up to the search operation. Our associates at the starport, Deep Space Mining, will provide further information including details of the reward.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:22:37Z","deprecated":false}
