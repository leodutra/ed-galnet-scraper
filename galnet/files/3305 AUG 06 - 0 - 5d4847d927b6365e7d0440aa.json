She gave an interview to Leon Banerjee for Vox Galactica: \n“I’ve been working with the professor for years now, and he’s taught me so much about rejigging modules to improve their function. He might come across as a bit serious, but Ishmael’s actually a total sweetheart. Although he’ll probably frown at me for saying that.”\n“I’d been thinking about striking out on my own for a while, and the creation of the Witch Head enclave seemed like a good opportunity to do just that. All those independent pilots have done so much for the new enclave, I thought it’d be good to offer a little support.”\nSedesi is currently overseeing the installation of a facility at Cinder Dock in Witch Head Sector DL-Y d17, which will offer engineering services similar to those previously offered at the Palin Research Centre.\nIt has also been confirmed that a tech broker and a material trader will be offering their services in the Witch Head Nebula, once the region’s starports have been returned to full functionality."}
