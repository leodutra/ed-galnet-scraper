These new bases will bridge the gap between the burgeoning Colonia community and the core systems.\"\nIn support of this ambitious initiative, Latugara PLC has placed an open order for titanium, computer components and power generators, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to its base of operations at Love Orbital in the Latugara system.\nThe campaign has been provisionally scheduled to run for four weeks from the 15th of September 3302, but the Latugara PLC has said it will run the campaign until its targets are met."}
