All chose to waive their final salaries and bonuses, which totalled approximately 365 million credits according to sources within the company.\nJournalist Bryanna Blanco commented in The Federal Times:\n“It has become apparent that the Federal Intelligence Agents who acquired our data on Zachary Rackham were in fact imposters working for him, employing fake credentials. With our research, Rackham would be capable of blackmailing fellow ex-pirate Taja Gavaris into resigning – the corporate equivalent of assassinating a rival.”\n“Naturally, we cannot prove this is what has occurred. But rest assured that we’ll continue keeping a close eye on Calico Zack.”\nThe Federal Times also confirmed that a donation of 36.5 million credits has been received from Rackham Capital Investments, ‘in recognition of the organisation’s dedication to ethical journalism’.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:41:21Z","deprecated":false}
