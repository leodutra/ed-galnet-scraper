The starport will serve as a centre for scientific research, gathering data on the supermassive black hole at the galaxy’s centre.\nErimus Kamzel, the Distant Worlds project leader, commented:\n“It is with great pride that we announce the successful conclusion to this resource-extraction initiative. The fleet will now continue its journey, and is scheduled to reach the galactic core in several weeks’ time.”\nContributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Omega Mining Operation in the Omega Sector VE-Q b5-15 system."}
