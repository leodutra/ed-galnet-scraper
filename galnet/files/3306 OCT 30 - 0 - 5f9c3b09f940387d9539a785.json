Congress has agreed to provide sanctuary, along with offers of permanent residency.\nImperial Ambassador Imogen Luciana stated:\n“Our people must be safely returned so we can identify dangerous NMLA activists, before they gain the opportunity to inflict further harm. We have no desire for the Federation to suffer the same horrific attacks.”\nA response was given by Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester:\n“As always, the Empire promises one thing and does another. This is not an altruistic effort to spare us from terrorists – it is a totalitarian purge of believers in democracy.”\nThere are reports that both superpowers have suspended many official channels of communication. Political commentators have observed that the Federation’s actions could be construed as the mass kidnapping of Imperial citizens, which would be an act of war.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:54:07Z","deprecated":false}
