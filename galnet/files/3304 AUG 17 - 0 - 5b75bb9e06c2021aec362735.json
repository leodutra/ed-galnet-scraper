We aim to address this by building a new hydroponics facility that will serve Colonia for generations to come.”\nThe campaign is being run by Colonia Research Division, one of Colonia’s partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver the requested mined resources to Templar Barracks in the Randgnid system.\nThe campaign begins on the 16th of August 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:38:33Z","deprecated":false}
