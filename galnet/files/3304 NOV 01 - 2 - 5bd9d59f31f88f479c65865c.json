In recent months, the organisation has become a genuine political force.”\n“The group’s leader is known only as the Imperator. Dressed in an Imperial Navy uniform, he is a charismatic presence who speaks of ‘a return to the honour of the old days’ and ‘the glory of Achenar’.”\n“Many traditionalist citizens, unhappy with recent cross-superpower cooperation, have embraced the Imperator’s rhetoric. On several worlds, Nova Imperium’s followers hold rallies with a distinctly martial feel.” \n“So far there has been little response from Imperial authorities, but it is clear that Nova Imperium will soon become impossible to ignore.”"}
