Although some were destroyed in battle, the remainder have abruptly withdrawn back into hyperspace.\nThe starports Chadwick Port and Ito Market sustained heavy damage during the assault, leaving thousands dead and wounded. Evacuation efforts are still underway to rescue the survivors from both stations.\nMarshal Noah Sharrow, the ruler of Cornsar, made this statement:\n“We cannot say why the Thargoids have gone, only that we are grateful they have. I thank all the brave pilots who fought valiantly to defend our people.”\nSightings of crashed Thargoid vessels on planetary bodies in the Cornsar system have been confirmed by Aegis observation teams. As yet there are no official explanations.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:18:58Z","deprecated":false}
