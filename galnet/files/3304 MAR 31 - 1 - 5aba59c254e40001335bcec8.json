These new ships will coordinate anti-Thargoid operations wherever they are deployed, and will support independent pilots.”\n“In response to recent Thargoid incursions, the Acropolis has been dispatched to the Lunguni system, while the Vanguard is operating in the Mentor system. However, their key advantage over a starport or base is their mobility, so both will periodically relocate to wherever they can be strategically effective.”\nAdmiral Tanner went on to stress the importance of the development:\n“Constructing these two gigantic vessels was a considerable undertaking for Aegis, but we are convinced the expense and effort is worthwhile. Our remit requires us to occupy a guiding role in the resistance against the Thargoids, and these megaships will bring that into focus.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:13:16Z","deprecated":false}
