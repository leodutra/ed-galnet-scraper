This reflects a belief that Aegis, which includes some of the galaxy’s foremost experts on non-human life, is best positioned to coordinate such efforts.”\n“We understand that some will lament this development, but the decision was arrived at only after careful consideration, and all parties have agreed on its necessity. Rest assured that our research initiatives will continue.”\nIt is understood that the organisation’s budget has been dramatically increased.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:00:39Z","deprecated":false}
