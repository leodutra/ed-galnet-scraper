This political gathering will also be attended by representatives from independent systems.\nAll parties have specified that their participation depends upon the event being successfully organised in neutral territory, and with sufficient resources and security in place. \nSirius Corporation and Utopia have begun to gather supplies to host the conference. Both have requested assistance from the galactic community to provide a broad range of data, which will be vital for planning security operations. Whichever organisation obtains the greatest amount of data will be deemed most suitable.\nThe following data sources are of interest to both parties: anomalous bulk scan data, atypical disrupted wake echoes, exceptional scrambled emission data and unusual encrypted files.\nSimguru Pranav Antal has called upon all pilots who support Utopiaâ€™s proposal to deliver the data to Tanner Settlement in the Polevnic system.\nCEO Li Yong-Rui has asked all those who believe Sirius Corporation to be a more suitable host to deliver the data to Goldstein Port in the Lembava system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:31:27Z","deprecated":false}
