This is evidenced by the huge numbers of citizens fleeing to Colonia.\nThe Colonia Council, the region’s governing body, has confirmed that the number of refugees has skyrocketed in recent weeks, and that the recent attacks against starports have only accelerated the rate of immigration.\nMagen Wolfe, a spokesperson for the Council, said:\n“All who seek sanctuary in Colonia will be welcomed, but the truth is that the core systems are no more likely to be targeted by the Thargoids than Colonia. We want to offer our support, but there is a limit to how many people the region can support.\"\nA campaign to build additional outposts in Colonia took place earlier this month, but the pace of immigration means that further construction initiatives may be necessary to support the region’s rapidly expanding population.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:11:26Z","deprecated":false}
