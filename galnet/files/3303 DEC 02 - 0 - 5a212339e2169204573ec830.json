That’s why these new research centres are so important. Everything we can learn about the Thargoids’ history, biology and psychology is of potential value.”\n“If we could understand the Thargoids – really understand them – perhaps we could broker some kind of truce. I, for one, have not given up on the idea of peace.”\n“Over the past few months, we have conducted a massive recruitment drive to secure some of the galaxy’s best and brightest minds. Now it’s time to find out what those minds can accomplish.”\nThe starports involved in the initiative include:\nArc's Faith, HR 1183\nArmstrong Enterprise, Bhal\nArtemis Lodge, Celaeno\nAsami Orbital, Pleiades Sector JC-V D2-62\nBao Landing, HIP 17497\nBeaufoy Vision, Nauni\nBennington's Rest, 42 N Persei\nBorrego's Vision, Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-7\nCavalieri, Electra\nCleaver Prospect, Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-57\nCopernicus Observatory, Asterope\nCyllene Orbital, Atlas\nExodus Point, Hyades Sector AB-W B2-2\nGaiman Dock, 49 Arietis\nHudson Observatory, HIP 17694\nKamov Survey, HIP 17892\nKipling Orbital, Pleiades Sector KC-V C2-11\nLiman Legacy, HIP 16753\nMalthus Terminal, Pleiades Sector HR-W D1-41\nObsidian Orbital, Maia\nReed's Rest, Merope\nRix Depot, Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-5\nThe Oracle, Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55\nTitan's Daughter, Taygeta\nWeyn Dock, 64 Arietis","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:11:41Z","deprecated":false}
