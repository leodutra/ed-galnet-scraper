Boom can also positively increase a minor faction’s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 50 minor factions experiencing an economic bust:\nZandu Jet Syndicate\nDemocrats of LTT 4961\nChi Orionis Vision Organisation\nBodhengue Independents\nConservatives of Zandu\nDefence Party of Arro Na\nSocial Tjakiri Progressive Party\nCaeritis Front\nUnited CD-58 538 Resistance\nBorasetani Syndicate\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction’s influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\n* Data is correct at time of publishing"}
