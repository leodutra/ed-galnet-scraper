Apparently, organisations in neighbouring systems – the Citizen Party of G146-60 and the Workers Party of G 176-29 – are attempting to cultivate discord in the system in order to pave the way for the introduction of communism.\nTo counter this threat, the Graill Redd Liberals have placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Graill Redd system, and have promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to J. G. Ballard Gateway.\nThe campaign begins on the 30th of June 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:25:59Z","deprecated":false}
