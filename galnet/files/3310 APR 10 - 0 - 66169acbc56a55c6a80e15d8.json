The data gathered from the components seems to have been the catalyst to finalise what were previously only theoretical designs.\nThe new modules are capable of incredible speeds, much like the Titans themselves. The power of this new Frame Shift Drive does, however, put immense pressure on a ship when used.\nIn a speech at the private launch event for the module, held at Achilles headquarters, Achilles Aerospace chairman Maxine Patro said:\n“As of right now, our new modules have been distributed across the galaxy, and we fully expect that this will not only be a turning point in history for Achilles, but for the whole of humanity. We have truly revolutionised supercruise and, with this leap, we take another step out from under the Thargoids’ technological shadow. Thank you, Achilles engineers.”","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:39:12Z","deprecated":false}
