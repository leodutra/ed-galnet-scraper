Interrogations revealed that a number of them were in fact junior officers in Sirius Corp’s private fleet.”\n“Other mercenaries confirmed that the attack was funded and organised by these individuals, which raises the question of why Sirius should be involved with this criminal enterprise.”\nThe engineer Ram Tah, who operates from Phoenix Base in the Meene system, commented:\n“Did Sirius really think it could obtain my research by force? Or was this an attempt to scare me into accepting Li Yong-Rui’s offer?”\nA spokesperson for the Sirius Corporation refuted any allegations of criminal activity, and insisted there would be a full inquiry.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:21:41Z","deprecated":false}
