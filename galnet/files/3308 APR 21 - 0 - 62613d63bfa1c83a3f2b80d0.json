These are expected to become operational by the 5th of May 3308.\nThe campaign’s conclusion was marked by a statement from First Minister Octavia Volkov:\n“Not for the first time in our turbulent history, we are indebted to all pilots who have shown support for the Marlinist Colonies. With these additional starports, we can increase local commerce and contribute to the wider economy.”\n“It is my sincere hope that our handful of systems will one day form the nucleus of a Marlinist Republic, which can peacefully co-exist alongside our Imperial cousins.”\nThe Free Marlinists of Carinae faction is now rewarding all pilots who took part in this initiative at Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system.\nIn related news, Prime Consul Kayode Tau has been invited to establish an office of the Marlinist Consulate on Capitol. This is being widely viewed as a sign of increased diplomatic tolerance from the Emperor.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:25:59Z","deprecated":false}
