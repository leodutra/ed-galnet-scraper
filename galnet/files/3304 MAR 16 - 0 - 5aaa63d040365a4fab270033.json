We don’t know as much about the Scouts as we do the Interceptors, so we want to compare materials from both variants and find out what they are made of.”\nAegis Core has appealed to independent pilots to support the operation by destroying Thargoids in Socho and by delivering Bio-Mechanical Conduits, Propulsion Elements and Weapon Parts to Dantec Enterprise. Commanders who participate in the operation will be generously rewarded.\nThe campaign begins on the 15th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:28:41Z","deprecated":false}
