According to Lavigny, the initiative is a direct response to the Federation's \"ongoing military build-up\". The admiral closed the conference with the words: \"We must continue to strengthen our fleet and reinforce our garrisons.\"\nLavigny's Legion has placed an open order for thallium, thermal cooling units and CMM composites for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested material to Marker Depot in the Carthage system. The campaign begins on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Empire's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:06:19Z","deprecated":false}
