The device is specifically designed to counter the caustic properties of Thargoid missiles.\nIn a statement, an Aegis spokesperson said:\n“As we know, the Thargoids’ enzyme missiles are particularly dangerous because of the caustic damage they inflict. The decontamination limpet is designed to address this by stripping the corrosive enzymes from a ship’s hull while also performing limited repairs.”\n“We have rigorously field tested the device and are confident that it will give pilots a distinct defensive advantage.”\nThe decontamination limpet can be purchased from planetary bases with military, high-tech, refinery, industrial or extraction-level economies.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:28:43Z","deprecated":false}
