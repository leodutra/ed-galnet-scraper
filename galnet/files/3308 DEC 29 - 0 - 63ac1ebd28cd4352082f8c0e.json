It is hoped that with these weapons improvements, humanity will be better positioned to defend itself against Thargoid invasion fleets.\nThe following weapons are now available for purchase:\nEnhanced AX Multi-cannon (Gimballed)\nEnhanced AX Missile Rack (Fixed)\nThese modules are offered at all rescue megaships, which can be found using the Galaxy Map filter. Ships looking to engage Thargoid forces are advised to equip these weapons, particularly in Maelstrom systems where Guardian-based technology has proven ineffective.","extractionDate":"2023-02-27T19:54:35Z","deprecated":false}
