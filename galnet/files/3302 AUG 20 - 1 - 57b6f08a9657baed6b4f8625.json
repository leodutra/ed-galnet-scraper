The Imperial Internal Security Service confirmed that it apprehended three individuals carrying firearms who attempted to approach the admiral's podium.\nFollowing the incident, Admiral Patreus appeared slightly shaken but said: \"I will never submit to terror. These individuals will be brought to justice.\"\nSubsequent reports identified the culprits as belonging to the organisation Emperor's Dawn, but it is rumoured that the dissidents were bankrolled and supported by a second party.\n\"Emperor's Dawn was smashed – it's history,\" said a researcher for the Imperial Citizen. \"Someone else was behind this – someone with a major grudge against Patreus.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:41:14Z","deprecated":false}
