The data allows pilots to determine which systems the Thargoids intend to attack.\nAdmiral Tanner elaborated on the issue in a brief statement:\n“With Dantec Enterprise experiencing widespread technical issues, it’s impossible for us to communicate with the Eagle Eye installations. And unless the installations are fed a continuous stream of data, they are essentially useless.”\n“The Eagle Eye installations are one of the most effective weapons we have in our war against the Thargoids, and we would be grateful to any pilots who could deliver meta-alloys to Dantec Enterprise, to help us get the starport back online.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:38:33Z","deprecated":false}
