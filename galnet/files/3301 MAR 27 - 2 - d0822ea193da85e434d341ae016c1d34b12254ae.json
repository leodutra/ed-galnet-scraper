By the end of the week long struggle, the Falisci Purple Gang’s leadership was in chains, and its members sold off to work as Imperial Slaves.\nThen the Social Falisci Party, backed by a coalition of Federal squadrons, began attempting to exert their influence over the system. Imperial pilots fought back until it became clear that the Federation had grown tired of its futile attempts to overthrow the rightful rulers of the region.\nThe region may be devastated and its people may be in chains, but the Emperor’s peace has finally come to Falisci.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:27:19Z","deprecated":false}
