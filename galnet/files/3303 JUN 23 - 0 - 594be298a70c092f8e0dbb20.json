Huge quantities of material were delivered to Obsidian Orbital for both the Federal campaign and the Imperial initiative.\nIt seems that despite widespread opposition to the Federal-Imperial conflict, both superpowers still enjoy considerable support among the galactic community.\nThe Merope Expeditionary Fleet, which coordinated the Imperial initiative, and the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, which oversaw the Federal campaign, have extended their gratitude to their supporters.\nPilots who contributed to the initiatives can now collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:39:05Z","deprecated":false}
