The spokesperson, Julissa Silver, released the following statement:\n\"It's true that we're planning something special. We invite everyone to come together, in a spirit of celebration, to commemorate the repeal of the ill-thought-out and short-lived prohibition laws here in the Carnoeck system. There will be many historic exhibits and displays, but most importantly there will be free bacon and libations for all visitors.\"\nImport demands in Carnoeck have hit new highs in recent weeks, and demand for goods continues to rise while locals speculate about the nature of the celebrations. One shuttle pilot was quoted as saying: \"Beer and liquor are flying out of depots faster than pilots can bring them in! It's going to be one heck of a party.\"\nMembers of the Bacon Cats have said that the celebrations will be positive and respectful, but some news outlets have raised concerns about the event, predicting astronomical policing costs, and speculating that it could attract pirates and other unwanted elements to the Carnoeck system.\nCommander Andius Solon","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:28:17Z","deprecated":false}
