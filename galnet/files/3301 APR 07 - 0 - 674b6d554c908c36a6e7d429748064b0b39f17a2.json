The group met with Duke Sanders to discuss the possibility of extending the remit of Brightlight Training’s Federal contracts. \nRepresenting the gold standard in private training centres, Brightlight offers a variety of educational services to corporations throughout the Federation. With the recent failures in communication between the Commander-in-Chief and her advisors in the Federal Navy, it appears that Admiral Vincent has decided it is long past time for the Navy to update the way its officers are trained.\nSources within the Brightlight Training Corporation are said to be very happy with the way the meeting went. No new contracts have been agreed between the two parties, but all reports indicate that Brightlight has begun ramping up its operations in preparation for an imminent services deployment.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:59:42Z","deprecated":false}
