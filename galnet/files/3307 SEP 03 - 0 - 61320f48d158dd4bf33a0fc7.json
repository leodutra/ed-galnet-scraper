The company successfully competed against Wreaken Corporation to establish a presence within LTT 198.\nMarlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica, observed:\n“Mastopolos Mining should be boasting about the positive start for its new subsidiary. Instead, its reaction has only confirmed the widening rift between the Mastopolos family and their corporation’s majority shareholder, Zemina Torval.”\n“CEO Gabriella Mastopolos officially distanced herself from the offshoot company, claiming it ‘hijacked our name with the intention of luring our clients’. And speaking to Imperial media, both Adrian and Elena Mastopolos criticised Constantia Torval’s suitability to act as operations director.”\n“Speculation persists as to why the families have become estranged. For now, Zemina Torval seems to be focusing solely on her direct descendants. With her youngest daughter Petra Torval becoming a fellow senator, and grandson Titus Torval promoted to a senior role in Imperial Intelligence, the future seems bright for the Torval dynasty.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:24:37Z","deprecated":false}
