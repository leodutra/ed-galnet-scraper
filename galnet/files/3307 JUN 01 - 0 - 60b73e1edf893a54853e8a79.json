Its megaship, Victory’s Forge, even managed to repel Federal troops and remains under Jupiter Division’s command.”\n“There is much speculation about the underlying reasons for this. Alongside general unrest with the Federation’s current policies, there is a rising interest in Rochester’s grand vision – replacing democracy with corporatocracy – among those wishing to see change. Many have flocked to Jupiter Division’s banner, preventing its collapse.”\n“Core Dynamics, its parent company, has also continued to see defections within its ranks. However, new CEO Owen McKenna has vowed to destroy his predecessor’s rogue department. It is possible that Jupiter Division’s survival was only a brief reprieve, unless the corporatists can gather in sufficient numbers to sustain it.”","extractionDate":"2021-07-12T21:46:45Z","deprecated":false}
