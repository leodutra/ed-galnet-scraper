Although they survived, the bombing left many thousands dead and injured.\nThe following message was sent across NMLA propaganda channels:\n“As long as a single Duval is left alive, the Republic of Achenar cannot be rebuilt. It is our duty to extinguish that entire line and free our people from Imperial oppression.”\nPraetor Leo Magnus gave a statement on behalf of ACT:\n“It is significant that this latest broadcast is not from Theta Seven, the NMLA’s mouthpiece and de facto leader. We believe that Theta Group – the team of weaponsmiths that built the caustic enzyme bombs – has split in two.”\n“According to the communications we intercepted, Theta Seven and half of his followers went into hiding after the attacks against the Marlinist Colonies in July. The others continued their terror campaign and were responsible for this latest atrocity. ACT is currently pursuing leads and hopes to learn more soon.”\nNova Imperium has repeated a call for pilots to help rescue survivors from Dyson City in the Paresa system.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:12:17Z","deprecated":false}
