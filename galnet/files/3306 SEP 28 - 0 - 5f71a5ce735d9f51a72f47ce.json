He has filed a plea of not guilty.\nThe prosecutor laid out the charges, including this summary:\n“According to the testimonies of three naval engineers, they installed replacement power regulator components to Starship One prior to its launch. Mr Webster verified this was routine maintenance during the initial investigation.”\n“Last year, one engineer reviewed data for the Highliner Antares incident and realised that pre-modified power regulators could have caused an identical Frame Shift Drive misjump on Starship One. She tried to trace the components’ source and found the records deleted.”\n“After Mr Webster refused to respond to her questions, she and her colleagues contacted the authorities, prompting a full inquiry.”\nThe Highliner Antares was a Sirius Corporation passenger liner that was destroyed in 3251 when its experimental hyperdrive engines malfunctioned. \nThe defence refuted the accusations as unprovable and motivated by personal grudges, making reference to Chief Technician Webster’s otherwise flawless record. \nThe trial is expected to conclude next week.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:24:21Z","deprecated":false}
