Ship manufacturers throughout the galaxy are now diverting research towards overcoming this issue.\nStent Jackson, a ship engineering and design consultant, spoke to Vox Galactica about this new surge of research:\n“Now don’t get me wrong, every manufacturer I’ve spoken to considers Supercruise Overcharge to be a great thing, but it’s also ripping our hulls apart. The good with the bad, as always.”\n“Funny thing is, every manufacturer is realising all at once that there are some crucial things about ship construction that they’ve all taken for granted. When you get down to brass tacks, we assume certain thresholds, right? Before, we didn’t need to worry about exceeding certain temperatures or hitting high levels of hull stress regularly. Now that’s all out the window.”\n“I haven’t seen such a single-minded focus from ship manufacturers for a long time. They’re all clawing to be first to market with a ship that can alleviate Overcharge stress, and it’s not long before one of them really does rise to the challenge.”\n\"My hat’s off to them, Achilles have changed the game in the industry for good.”","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:32Z","deprecated":false}
