According to Sam Norris, a technician at Coats Hub, the system's inhabitants are dealing with a range of problems:\n\"We've had power outages, intermittent problems with our communications, and issues with the docking systems, but I've reason to believe that things are worse at Gurragchaa Gateway. I haven't been able to establish a stable comms link with them for a while, though, so I don't know exactly what the situation is.\"\nNorris was asked what he thought might be causing the problems:\n\"Beats the hell out of me. The generators are fine and I haven't identified any infrastructure issues, so we'll need to run some tests before we can be sure.\"\nThe issues in Warkushanui are not believed to be affecting station services at this time.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:59:06Z","deprecated":false}
