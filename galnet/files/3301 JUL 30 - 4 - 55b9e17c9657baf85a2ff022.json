In this fifth article he analyses Federal President Zachary Hudson.\nRepublican President Zachary Hudson  became President after the disappearance of President Halsey and a vote of no confidence in the Senate. He has always been supportive of the military, and has recently announced his support for CQC Championship as a training and recruitment tool for the Federal Navy. He is also approving additional funds to begin upgrading and expanding the fleet to counter the threats he sees beyond the Federation’s borders.\nIn common with most of his party, Hudson believes it is the government’s duty to be as small a burden on the individual as possible. An extensive programme of tax reduction is already planned for most households within the Federation. This has proved popular, but not for those who relied on government support before his election.\nHe is also an advocate of personal freedom at any cost, although that is balanced by the requirement for citizens to be responsible for themselves.\nFor fun, the President regularly goes hunting on the many frontier worlds offering holiday activity.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:32:42Z","deprecated":false}
