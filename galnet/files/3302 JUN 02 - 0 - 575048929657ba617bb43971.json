Recent reports indicate that agitators have been attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.\nTo counter this threat, Mehet Ltd has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Mehet system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Schwann Dock.\nThe campaign begins on the 2nd of June 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:52:01Z","deprecated":false}
