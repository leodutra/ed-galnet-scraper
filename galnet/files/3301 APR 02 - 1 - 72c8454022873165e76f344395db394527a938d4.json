She was reported as saying that she had found it “Most enlightening” and wanted to express her thanks to all who had helped her “navigate the fiendishly complicated Federation protocols.”\nLady Kahina was then asked “Do you consider the docking officials at Mars High to be friends or rivals?”\nHer reply was greeted with laughter over wide-band comms. “Oh, that’s easy. Neither.”\nRepresentatives from Mars High could not be reached for comment."}
