System security forces were caught off guard by the violence, which began without warning and has escalated rapidly since then.\nBoth sides have issued calls for aid, appealing to independent combat pilots for support. Commanders who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction.\nA representative of system security forces issued the following statement:\n“It would be irresponsible of us to encourage independent pilots to join this fight, but if the galactic community can bring this conflict to a swift end, they will have our gratitude.”\nThe two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 14th of September 3303."}
