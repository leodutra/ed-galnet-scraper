Aegis is doing commendable work, but it needn't be our only line of defence.\"\nImperial commentators have criticised the initiative, however, drawing attention to long-standing conventions against the development of artificial intelligence. Shadow President Winters was quick to dismiss such concerns, saying:\n\"The purpose of the Bulwark Project is to investigate alternative defence strategies, not to develop machine intelligence.\"\nThe operation has received financial support from the Momoirent Central and Co, which has placed an open order for various commodities for use in the campaign.\nThe campaign begins on the 15th of February 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
