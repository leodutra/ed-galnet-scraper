Among them, the organisation which provided the would-be-killer for use in this foul conspiracy.”\n“This stain against our Empire’s honour will not be allowed to stand. Justice will be done this day.”\n“Hail to the Emperor, bask in his glory.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:20:06Z","deprecated":false}
