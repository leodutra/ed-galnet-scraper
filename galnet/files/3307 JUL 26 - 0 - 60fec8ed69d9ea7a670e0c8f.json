In many cases, they are being arrested for planning to commit crimes against the constitution.\nDeputy Director Bethany Blake, who runs the PDB, gave a statement to the media:\n“I can confirm that gathering such intelligence is within our legal remit. Unilateral declarations of independence are criminal acts that violate the Federal Accord. Therefore we are identifying perpetrators before they cause harm, which is precisely what our surveillance network was established to do.”\nIn Congress, Vice President Jerome Archer defended the PDB for boosting arrest rates and saving lives. However, Congressman Bai Zheng remarked that the PDB was “incapable of locating the NMLA, but fantastic at finding enemies among our own people that didn’t previously exist”.\nBoth President Hudson and Shadow President Winters have personally contacted the leaders of many systems within their spheres of influence, aiming to address their concerns and convince them not to secede from the Federation.","extractionDate":"2021-07-27T00:40:33Z","deprecated":false}
