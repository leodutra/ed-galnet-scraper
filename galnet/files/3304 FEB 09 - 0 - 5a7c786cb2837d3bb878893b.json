Huge quantities of raw materials were delivered to Bulychev Hub over the past week, which will be used to build an Orbis starport in the Synuefai EB-R c7-5 system.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Alliance official Torvan Dast issued a statement, thanking those who supported the campaign and adding:\n“By providing Alliance convoys and independent pilots with a much-needed resupply point, we hope this new starport will be the first step in transforming what is currently an outlying enclave into a thriving community.”\nConstruction of the new starport is expected to begin soon. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Bulychev Hub in the LP 128-32 system."}
