Independent and Federal Commanders flocked from all across the galaxy in an attempt to repel Senator Denton Patreus’s attempts to extract the debts owed to him by the Quiviran government. Early attempts at repelling the Senator’s mercenary forces proved to be a success, and the freedom fighters were able to buy enough time for the People’s Quivira for Equality Party to evacuate a great many innocent civilians to neighbouring systems.\nUnfortunately, once the Party’s credits ran out, so too did the support of Independent and Federal pilots.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:29:59Z","deprecated":false}
