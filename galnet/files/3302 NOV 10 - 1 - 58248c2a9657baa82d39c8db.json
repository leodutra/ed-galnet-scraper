It is understood the group used the pesticide as the basis for a potent chemical weapon.\nThe impact on the starport has been catastrophic. Over a dozen individuals have lost their lives, and hundreds more are in critical condition. As a result, the starport has been closed until further notice.\nSystem security forces have already started hunting for Revolution Incorporated, but with little physical evidence and few leads, the chances of bringing the culprits to justice are slim.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:43:27Z","deprecated":false}
