With the 'Wildcard' stage of the competition over, it is time for the main event to begin.\nTrinity Avon, a reporter for The Sovereign, explained how the Rise to Power will work:\n\"There are six factions taking part: the EG Pilots, the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, the Border Coalition, GalCop, the Interstellar Communist Union and the Social Eleu Progressive Party. Over the next three weeks, there will be a series of campaigns in which each faction will try to rally as much support as possible. The faction that dominates its rivals will join the ranks of the galaxy's most powerful.\"\nThe first Rise to Power event requires pilots to gather Gilya signature weapons for their chosen faction and deliver them to Gohar Station in the Jaradharre system. The faction that accumulates the most Gilya signature weapons will be declared the winner of the first heat.\nThe event begins on the 30th of June 3302 and will run for one week."}
