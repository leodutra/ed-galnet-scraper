When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nKoar Silver Syndicate\nDrug Empire of Karakamane\nComanga Crimson Crew\nMu Gong Silver Rats\nChokota Future\nHoliacan Dynamic Company\nChnumar Crimson Posse\nLTT 2771 as one\t\nAisling's Angels\nSocial Tarach Tor Union Party\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished.
