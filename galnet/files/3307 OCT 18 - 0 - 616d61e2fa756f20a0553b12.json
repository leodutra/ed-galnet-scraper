The university will shortly dispatch a megaship to take ownership and arrange repatriation for its current occupants.”\nThe dredger is currently orbiting an ice world in the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system. It is believed to be collecting raw material from planetary rings to sustain its onboard systems, a design feature that allows it to remain self-sufficient indefinitely.\nThere has been no communication with the Scriveners Clan, the spacefaring tribe descended from an academic institute that was later absorbed into Orion University. It is known that they shun contact with all outsiders to protect their Knowledge Core, a repository of research conducted over the past two centuries.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:13:57Z","deprecated":false}
