The Imperial blockade of Harma and the surrounding systems has intercepted thousands of these slaves, many of whom are emaciated, deeply bruised, and otherwise afflicted.\nOne fresh graduate of the Imperial Naval Academy had this to say regarding his observations:\n\"10 years ago my family had a slave. It wasn't until he paid his debts and returned to his family that I learned he was not my brother. My father told me on that day to remember Peter, my “older brother,” because I too may become indebted, or sponsor a slave like my \"brother.\" That is Imperial Slavery. This... this slavery must be destroyed.\"\nPhilanthropic representatives of Sirius Corp. have extended humanitarian services by returning the slaves, liberated by the Imperial fleet, to their homes and families.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:12:27Z","deprecated":false}
