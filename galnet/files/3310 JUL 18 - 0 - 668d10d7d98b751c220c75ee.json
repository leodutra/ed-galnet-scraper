A spokesperson from Federal Liberal Command, the Rhea system’s controlling faction, said:\n“This has been a beacon of hope and support for a planet besieged by misfortune, and these supplies will be of enormous help. Thank you. We have now authorised the delivery of rewards at Ito Orbital for all pilots who took part in this initiative.”\nPresident-elect Felicia Winters gave a statement to the press from a newly built medical facility outside the recovering capital city New Greenacre:\n“I can find no words to describe the horror of what happened here. Nor can I fully express my gratitude to everyone who provided aid and assistance. To the people of the Federation: thank you for allowing me time to grieve. Planning has resumed for the inauguration, and I hope that my administration will officially begin soon.”\nPolitical opinions regarding Felicia Winters delaying her term of office have been varied. Many Republican officials claimed that this showed weakness, as expressed by Congressman Thandeka Qwabe: “A president should put the Federation as a whole before their own personal situation.”\nThe Liberal Party supported the decision, with Congressman Bai Zheng insisting: “Nobody could be expected to perform their duties while mourning the deaths of so many family members. Let’s not chastise our new president for being more human than the last one.”","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:48Z","deprecated":false}
