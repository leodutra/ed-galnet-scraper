Huge quantities of raw material were delivered to California Gateway over the past week, which will be used to construct an Ocellus starport in the MEL 22 Sector GM-V C2-8 system.\nWith the campaign at an end, Alliance official Torvan Dast issued the following statement:\n“We are grateful for the efforts made by those pilots who helped bring this initiative to fruition. Construction of this starport will make the long journey to the California Nebula safer for traders and colonists alike.”\nConstruction of the new starport is expected to begin soon. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from California Gateway in the Synuefai EB-R C7-5 system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:55:44Z","deprecated":false}
