The organisation has also placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the LFT 133 system to ensure that those delivering gold can do so safely.\nPilots who deliver gold to Sullivan Dock, and who help neutralise the agitators operating in the LFT 133 system, will be rewarded.\nThe campaign begins on 1st of September 3302 and will run for one week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:57:46Z","deprecated":false}
