That is why we are humbly requesting the help of the galactic community in building this installation.”\n“Once complete, it will allow pilots from across the galaxy – irrespective of their allegiance – to work together in resisting the Thargoid threat.”\nIn support of this goal, the Privateers Alliance has placed an open order for various commodities, and has pledged to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Barjavel Station in the HIP 33368 system.\nThe campaign begins on the 5th April of 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:03:30Z","deprecated":false}
