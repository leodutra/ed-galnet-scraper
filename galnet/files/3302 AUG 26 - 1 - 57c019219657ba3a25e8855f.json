It is dangerous and irresponsible to venture into uncharted areas without proper discipline.\"\n\"What we need is sound astrocartographic data â€“ not a bunch of amateurs traipsing all over the place and making a complete mess of the whole situation.\"\n\"I will be making deputations to various authorities to curtail these activities and leave exploration in the hands of the professionals.\"\n\"If humanity finds itself in a first-contact position, do we really want some grubby, ill-prepared spacer to be our envoy? I think not.\"","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:12:13Z","deprecated":false}
