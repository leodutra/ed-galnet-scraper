I only meant that if it is Thargoid, it's likely to be a relic of the past.\"\n\"It's true that I haven't done much field science recently, but I plan to visit the site soon, and I'll be looking for indications of whether this is a recent find or something that has been sitting on the surface for a while.\"\nJaiotu"}
