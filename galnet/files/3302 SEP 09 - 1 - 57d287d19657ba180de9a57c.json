But we never planned to keep the discovery from the public.\"\n\"The point is that we found it – me and my friends. But now the discovery has been credited to someone else! It's outrageous!\"\nCommentators have been quick to point out that Granger's efforts to profit from the discovery, and his reluctance to share it with the galactic community in a spirit of altruism, are sufficient grounds to deny him credit."}
