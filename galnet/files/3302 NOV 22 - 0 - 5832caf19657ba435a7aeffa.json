The event starts at the Noctrach-Ihazevich Research facility and involves driving to the nearby crash site, 'kicking the alien', and then driving back to the research facility as fast as possible.\nA representative for the Buckyball Racing Club said: \"All other methods of interaction with the crash sites have failed to get a response â€“ perhaps this will wake them up\".\nThe race starts on Saturday the 26th of November and is expected to last for two weeks. Competitors can make their run at any time during this period, and can run as many times as they like.\nCommander Alec Turner","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:39:22Z","deprecated":false}
