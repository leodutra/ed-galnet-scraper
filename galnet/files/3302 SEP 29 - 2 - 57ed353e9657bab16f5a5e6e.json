System authorities have responded by establishing a refugee centre at the Bujold Enterprise starport, but have found themselves unable to provide the many refugees with medicine and shelter.\nThe Kalana Independents have therefore offered to fund a coordinated relief effort. The organisation has placed an open order for basic medicines and evacuation shelters, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Bujold Enterprise in the Kalana system.\nThe campaign begins on the 29th of September 3302 and will run for one week. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:42:12Z","deprecated":false}
