GalCop's representative, Jahena Yar Savor, addressed both sides of the conflict, and appealed for an end to hostilities in the spirit of cooperation and unity.\n\"Our differences must not be settled through violence,\" said Savor. \"This conflict may have begun because of ideals, but it has led to very real damage.
