Frankly, she shouldn't be described as a 'lady', either, but we will let the courts make that determination.\"\nThis means Loren will now be tried based on the laws of her nominated home system, which is of course the Prism system. Loren has been moved from Achenar and is presumed to be en route to Prism, under guard.\nWhile Prism remains under the supervision of Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney, it is heavily exploited by Admiral Patreus. Patreus's aide said: \"Those without a proper appreciation of due process might believe there is a conflict of interest, given Admiral Patreus's influence in Prism, but we can ensure the galactic community that Imperial law will be followed to the letter.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:00:26Z","deprecated":false}
