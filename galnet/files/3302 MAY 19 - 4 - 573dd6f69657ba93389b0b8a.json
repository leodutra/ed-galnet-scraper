In a succinct statement, the spokesperson thanked those who supported the campaign.\n\"We are very grateful to the many independent pilots who helped us fulfil our commercial obligations. The tantalum will now be delivered to our various partners.\"\nSince the campaign began, rumours have persisted that the tantalum was destined for a group of independent engineers.
