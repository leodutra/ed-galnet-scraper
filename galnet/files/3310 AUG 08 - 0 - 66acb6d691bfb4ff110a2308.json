I am especially concerned about the increasing risk of our advancements being duplicated, as with the Vitadyne nanomedicines that were stolen from us. Misuse of our other inventions could lead to a shift in power or colossal casualties, something my conscience will not permit.”\n“And yet, while Utopia's gaze remains fixed on the horizon of humanity’s potential, the corporations we seek to avoid insist on making their presence felt. External suppliers to our commune have been bought or dissuaded by Li Yong-Rui, who hopes to leverage an exchange agreement between us. Such tactics put the archives of physical data which inform our simulation technology at risk of becoming outdated.”\n“I am hesitant to send members of my community to collect samples for our reference libraries and expose them to elements that would take advantage of them. Therefore, I ask members of the galactic community to bring research samples to Polevnic in exchange for an appropriate payment.”\nSirius Corportation have not responded to requests for comment at the time of this article.\nUtopia’s initiative is being organised by the Guardians of Harmony faction. Submissions of classified scan databanks, cracked industrial firmware and unexpected emissions data can be delivered to Tanner Settlement starport in the Polevnic system.\nA parallel request for animal monitors, auto-fabricators, and micro controllers has also been made, and deliveries of these commodities can also be made at Tanner Settlement.","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:40Z","deprecated":false}
