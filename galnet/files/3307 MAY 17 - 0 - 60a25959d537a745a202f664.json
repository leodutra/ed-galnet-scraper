She has done little to secure the prosperity of our people and companies, which was my primary focus over the last six years.”\nAt a protest march on New Caledonia in the Alkaid system, Councillor Kaine addressed the crowd:\n“Again, the Thargoids lash out at our presence. Again, we prop up the other superpowers. Again, we pump money into Aegis and Lakon but not our own economies. Nothing changes, unless Mahon is voted out and the Alliance takes a new direction!”\nOpinion polls suggest that Mahon has retained majority support, but with a narrower margin than in February when the election was originally scheduled. Many agree with Kaine that the Alliance should not have participated in the Galactic Summit, which led to the ‘Nine Martyrs’ bombings.","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:47:38Z","deprecated":false}
