This pathogen – named the Cerberus Plague – eventually spread to over 20 systems and claimed 100,000 lives.\nThanks to the support of the galaxy's independent pilots, a cure derived from Ceremonial Heike Tea was discovered and used to treat victims at Hart Station in the Bast System. The cure was then synthesised, mass produced and shipped to other affected systems. On the 10th of August 3301, the last affected systems were declared free of the Cerberus Plague.\nIn tribute to these pilots' heroic efforts, the Buckyball Racing Club is hosting a special event at Hart Station. The race will involve a scramble around nearby medicine-production facilities and a speed run to Brunel City in Heike.\nCommander Raiko","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:53:04Z","deprecated":false}
