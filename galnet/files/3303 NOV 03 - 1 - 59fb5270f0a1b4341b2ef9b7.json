Hundreds of pilots took to their ships to deliver goods to the LHS 2094 system for an opulent Halloween party, and to protect those ferrying commodities to Patterson Vision.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 released the following statement:\n“This is going to be one of the greatest Halloween parties of all time! Who cares if the Thargoids kill us all – at least we’ll go out with a bang. And we won’t have to live with the hangover!”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Patterson Vision in the LHS 2094 system."}
