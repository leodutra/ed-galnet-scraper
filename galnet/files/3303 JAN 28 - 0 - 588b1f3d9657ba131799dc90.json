And true to form, he has made some rather implausible claims.\nOn his programme 'Behind the Curtain', Bentonio said:\n\"I am in contact with an individual who has irrefutable proof that these ships are Thargoid vessels. And what's more, I have been reliably informed that the Thargoids have been exerting direct influence over human society. Everything that is happening is unfolding according to their plan. Soon, it will be too late!\"\nFew in the media or the world of politics deigned to respond to Bentonio's claims.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:57:17Z","deprecated":false}
