The starport is a major manufacturing centre for autonomous defence drones, more commonly known as skimmers.\nAccording to a leaked report, the Imperial organisation Chimechilo Empire League plans to disrupt skimmer production at Thoreau Orbital by flooding it with explosives. The Chimechilo Empire League has asked Imperial pilots to support the operation by delivering explosives to Thoreau Orbital.\nTo counter this threat, the Obotrima Organisation has asked Federation-aligned pilots to deliver skimmer components and robotics to the outpost in order to manufacture new skimmers.\nBoth operations are scheduled to run for one week from the 15th of September 3302.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:48:07Z","deprecated":false}
