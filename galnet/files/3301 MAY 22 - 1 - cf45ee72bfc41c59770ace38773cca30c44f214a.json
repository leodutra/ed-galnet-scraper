She accessorised with an equally stunning tinted visor, fashionably stamped with Aisling’s personal crest.\nSurprisingly, the people’s princess only stayed at the installation for a little over an hour. Aisling left the show long before midnight, citing exhaustion from her recent activities in the Summerlands as the reason behind her early exit."}
