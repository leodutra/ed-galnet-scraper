When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nHIP 111755 Gold Cartel\nIapodes Purple Dynamic Holdings\nNLTT 6667 Republic Party\nGreen Party of CD-54 4840\nSurya PLC\nCrimson Transport Ltd\nFuture of Udegoci\nCarpaka Central Industry\nHIP 1419 Empire Consulate\nUnion of Kappa Phoenicis Labour\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:45:59Z","deprecated":false}
