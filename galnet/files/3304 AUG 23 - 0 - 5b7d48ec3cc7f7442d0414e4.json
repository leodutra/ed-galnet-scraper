We have contacted everyone involved with the event and closed down all related projects.”\nThe announcement follows anti-slavery campaigner Jarl Toredo’s confession that he and Aisling Duval were romantically involved for several months. Toredo also claimed that the planned marriage was purely a political matter.\nThe cancellation was confirmed by the Imperial Palace on Emerald, but there has been no direct response from Princess Duval or Ambassador Rochester. \nPolitical journalist Cassia Carvalho of The Imperial Herald commented:\n“The fact that this news comes from Isolde Rochester gives weight to Jarl Toredo’s claims. If the marriage was a political scheme, that may explain why the Rochester family matriarch is the one to call it off, no longer trusting Princess Duval to play her part. Or perhaps this is simply the reaction of a mother, enraged at her future daughter-in-law’s infidelity.”\n“Had the marriage taken place, would it have initiated an era of Federal-Imperial cooperation, or triggered a new wave of conflict? It seems we will never know.”"}
