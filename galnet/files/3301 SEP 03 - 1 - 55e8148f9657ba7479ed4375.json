Criminals and dissidents aren't evil – they've just become disconnected from society. We've proved time and again that seeing the world through the eyes of others, through technology, can be a healing experience.\"\nDr McNamara declined to elaborate further on the nature of Utopia's corrective sims, or to address rumours that those subjected to these treatments manifest radically altered personalities.\nCommander Jendrassik","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:44:22Z","deprecated":false}
