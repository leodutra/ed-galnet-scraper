The development triggered a decisive response from Empire-aligned pilots, who made repeated attempts to destabilise the campaign. Ultimately, the Federation was able to complete the operation, but the Federation's opponents had made their feelings clear â€“ the superpower's military expansion would not proceed unopposed.\nNow the Federation has announced plans to establish a new planetary outpost in the HIP 17225 system, which it claims will serve as \"a trade and resource-processing hub\". Those familiar with HIP 17225 A 1 will be all too aware that the planet is home to a number of barnacle sites.\nThe Federation has placed an open order for tantalum, building fabricators and energy grid assemblies with which to construct the new base, and has authorised the Future of Segovan to reimburse pilots who deliver these materials to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.\nThe campaign begins on the 28th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Federation's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:22:26Z","deprecated":false}
