Unleashed from within these corrosive clouds were Thargoid attacks on a scale never seen before. Hundreds of systems fell rapidly, with the current death toll over a billion. Billions more were forced to flee from their burning homes.”\n“It was months before the Thargoid motherships within the Maelstroms were revealed. The Titans remain in place to this day, seemingly indestructible. Their unearthly horror was enhanced when it became clear that they are also prisons for living humans abducted by the aliens.”\n“With a reformed Aegis in place, our resistance to these invasions grew stronger over the months. Many fallen systems were recovered, and courageous pilots destroyed countless Thargoid vessels. Their efforts were boosted by technological breakthroughs such as the pulse wave xeno scanner, Thargoid pulse neutraliser and sub-surface extraction missile.”\n“More recently, a contaminant developed by Professor Ishmael Palin proved effective against the Thargoid spire sites that emerged on dozens of planets. Another recent success was the clearing of all systems around Taranis. This raises the prospect that other Thargoid fleets could be beaten back to their motherships.”\n“Perhaps the most incredible victory is the liberation of hundreds of thousands of abducted people from captivity within the Titans. All were kept in strict quarantine since their return, undergoing tests to ensure that they were not somehow influenced by the Thargoids.”\n“Now, however, the Alliance has decided to allow its citizens to return home. Other governments are more cautious, but this has not stopped returnees from receiving gifts, calls and visits from their friends and families. There has been a concerted effort to alleviate their horrific ordeal and reconnect with them as much as possible.”\n“And so, as 3310 dawns, there is real hope that this most terrible period of history may have some end in sight. This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there.”","extractionDate":"2024-02-08T21:50:40Z","deprecated":false}
