When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nPrismatic Imperium\nHIP 5623 Crimson United Services\nSocial Wolf 397 Progressive Party\nSiluror Group\nBrotherhood of LP 98-132\nMovement for Kambila Labour\nGang of Aphra\nLhou Xuang Prison Colony\nFederation Unite!\nHDS 3215 Defence Party\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending."}
