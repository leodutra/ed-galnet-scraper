Other Federal Intelligence Agency operatives moved to arrest Cole’s acolytes and secure the control deck.”\n“We’ve since learned that Karim’s unit was posing as Tothos worshippers eager to join the cult. They had staged the death of a team member to receive access to the starport.”\n“The Lucifer Device has now been disarmed and secured, while station services are returning to normal.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:37:48Z","deprecated":false}
