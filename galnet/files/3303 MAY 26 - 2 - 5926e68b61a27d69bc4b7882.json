Hundreds of tonnes of commodities were delivered to KatherineB over the week, following an enthusiastic response from the galactic community.\nAs the initiative drew to a close, the organisation released a statement:\n“Every pilot who responded to our appeal has our sincerest gratitude. Thanks to you, the event was an unalloyed triumph.”\nReports indicate that the event’s success has already had a positive impact on the economy of Zeus, as evidenced by the fact that The Midas, a Wells-class carrier, has relocated to the system. It is hoped that the vessel will remain in the region to serve as a commercial hub.\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from KatherineB in the Zeus system."}
