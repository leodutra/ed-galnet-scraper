Our assumption is that the ship was attacked and its cargo stolen. Evidently, Professor Rook acquired Utopian technology and is now passing it off as her own creation.”\n“These nanomedicines were never intended for use outside of Utopia. Such sophisticated materials can only be controlled by Utopian engineers. We demand that our property be returned to us immediately.”\nThere has been no response from Vitadyne Labs. The Interstellar Health Organisation has said that it will investigate Pranav Antal’s accusation.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:55:31Z","deprecated":false}
