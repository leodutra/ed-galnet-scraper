The victor of the so-called 'Wildcard' competition will go on to vie for the right to be recognised as an official power.\nThe first Wildcard event required pilots to fire up their mining lasers and gather gold for their chosen faction. Predictably, the week-long event saw no small measure of conflict, with pilots doing everything they could to disrupt their rivals' operations.\nThe final tally indicates that the EG Pilots received the largest quantity of gold. But whether or not this will result in ultimate victory remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the three-week campaign.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:58:17Z","deprecated":false}
