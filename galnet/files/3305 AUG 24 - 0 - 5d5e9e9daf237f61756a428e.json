Shows ranging from elaborate stage productions to amateur street recitals have offered classical operas, circus shows, theatrical plays and much more.\nArt critic Bryony Lindholm published this review on Vox Galactica:\n“While the entertainment on display has been nothing short of marvellous, a personal favourite has been the ballet ‘Bones of Dreams’. It is performed by skeletal robot dancers made of scrap salvaged from the Tionisla orbital graveyard.”\n“It is a moving portrayal of inhumanity, and like most of the audience, I was left in tears despite – or perhaps because of – the absence of any sentient organisms depicting grand themes of grief and loss.”\nThe Alliance Festival of Culture continues next week in Alioth and will feature a presentation at the Garden City Gallery."}
