Well it's not funny. It's sick. She should be ashamed of herself. \"\n\"Does President Halsey even stand for anything? Seems to me all she does is chase around desperately trying to get people to like her. Well, newsflash, Mrs President, no one likes you.\"\n\"I think the President is a good woman. She did a lot of good back home and I'm sure she could do a lot of good as a member of Congress. A good President though? No. I'm afraid she's just not a good fit.\"\n\"I didn't vote for her then, and I wouldn't vote for her now!\"","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:52:09Z","deprecated":false}
