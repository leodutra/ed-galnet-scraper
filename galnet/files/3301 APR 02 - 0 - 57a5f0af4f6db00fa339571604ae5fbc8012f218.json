The Chancellor remained stoic as he once again turned aside calls to clarify the line of succession, saying:\n\"I have been assured that the attempted attack on our beloved Emperor has not had any overly adverse effects on his health. The would be assassin has undone much of the good work that had been made towards his majesty's recovery. Yet the Emperor still lives. In time, I am confident he will be with us again.\"\n\"Thanks to the tireless efforts of agents working on behalf of Princess Arissa, the assassin has been captured and is currently undergoing questioning. We don't expect to learn anything useful from the tool herself, but security forensic techs are analysing everything about the traitorâ€™s life as we speak. Have no doubt. We will find who ordered the attack, and we will bring them to justice.\""}
