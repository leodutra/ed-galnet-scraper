Sirius is far better placed in terms of logistics and security, and our navy will be able to ensure the safe transportation of all delegates.”\n“Furthermore, we already have excellent commercial relationships with the Alliance, Empire and Federation, and can therefore guarantee neutrality. Our recent philanthropic gesture at creating the Marlinist Colonies proves that we are an impartial, stabilising force for the whole galaxy.”\nDiscussions regarding the conference have been ongoing in superpower and independent systems alike. Some leaders have decried it as a pointless exercise, while others view it as a rare opportunity for political cohesion.\nSirius Corporation and Utopia’s propositions for a Galactic Summit are now being compared by potential attendees. However, Zachary Rackham’s offer to host the conference at the actual galactic summit of Rackham’s Peak is not being seriously considered."}
