The hope is that this will lead to the development of more effective defences against the Thargoids. We therefore require new samples to compare with Ram Tah’s groundbreaking work on this mysterious species.”\n“Guardian artefacts including those previously identified as caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns are needed. These can be unearthed from the ancient ruins scattered across dozens of worlds.”\n“I beseech the galactic community to support this project. It is vital that Aegis continues to receive funding, and to achieve this we must push the boundaries of our knowledge even further.”\nPilots are asked to deliver their shipments to Aegis Research at the Alexandria megaship in the Delphi system.","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:45:45Z","deprecated":false}
