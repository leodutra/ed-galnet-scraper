Inspired by the Federal insignia, the intention was for the sculpture to be visible above Olympus Village, and seen by millions of people.”\n“But upon activation, the image that materialised was a gigantic cat's face, winking repeatedly. The original holo-sculpture code was later discovered to have vanished.”\nThe Federal Security Service believes the culprit to be the same art thief who stole valuable works on Alioth and Eotienses A 3, both of which were marked with an identical ‘winking cat’ motif.\nThere are no leads at present."}
