Independent pilots have been asked to take part in anti-xeno initiatives within the region, which are being coordinated from The Mictlan megaship. \nHarrison Gladstone of the Turner Research Group, which represents the Alliance in the California Nebula, made a formal protest:\n“We are not happy about defence initiatives being funded by a ruthless criminal gang. These pirates are using the Thargoid attacks to expand their illegal activity, thus jeopardising our faction’s scientific and commercial interests. Several of our ports in the area are now under Kumo Crew ‘emergency protections’, as they’ve termed it. This is an illegal occupation of Allied territory!”\nIn response, Archon Delaine claimed:\n“Taking charge of local security forces is necessary to form an effective anti-xeno militia. If the Alliance cares so much about this region, where are their warships? We’re doing Mahon’s job for him. The colonists here will soon understand our decision is the correct one.”\nThe Kumo Council has agreed to reimburse all Thargoid combat bonds handed in at The Mictlan in California Sector HR-W d1-28.","extractionDate":"2023-02-27T19:54:07Z","deprecated":false}
