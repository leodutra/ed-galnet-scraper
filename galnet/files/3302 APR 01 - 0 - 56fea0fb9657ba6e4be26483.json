That's because there are two systems that bear the name 'Naraka'.\nThis quirk of circumstance has long been a source of confusion for independent pilots, but Universal Cartographics has deigned to address the issue by renaming the former of the two systems.\nA Federal spokesperson released a brief statement:\n\"Until Universal Cartographics has dealt with this issue, all travel to the Naraka system has been restricted. Access to the Naraka system located between Pi-Fang and Eranin remains unhindered.\"\nNot everyone is happy about the impending change, however, with one resident of the soon-to-be renamed system remarking:\n\"This is all well and good, but what will happen to my mail? It's like Universal Cartographics didn't even consider the postal service.\""}
