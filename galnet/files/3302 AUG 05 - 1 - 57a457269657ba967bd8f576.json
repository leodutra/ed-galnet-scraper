The development follows a recent initiative to add three new capital ships to the Imperial fleet.\nIn a statement, Federal President Zachary Hudson spoke candidly about the motivation behind the campaign.\n\"We live in uncertain times, and we are on the brink of an uncertain future. When I speak to the people of the Federation, I want to be able to promise them that their homes and families are safe. By contributing to this campaign, you can help me keep that promise.\"\nThe Federation has placed an open order for autofabricators, tantalum and superconductors for use in the construction, and has authorised the Workers of Gooheimar Alliance to reward pilots who deliver the requested materials to Brady Horizons in the Gooheimar system.\nThe campaign begins on the 4th of August 3302 and will run for one week. If the Federation's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:52:32Z","deprecated":false}
