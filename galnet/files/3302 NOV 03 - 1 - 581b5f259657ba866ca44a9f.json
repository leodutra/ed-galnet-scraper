It is now believed that if the group did have nefarious intent, its plans were foiled.\nBut despite this apparent setback, the organisation itself has endured, having issued the following message to media outlets and social networks throughout the galaxy:\n\"Last time, they stopped us. This time, they will not. The powers-that-be must accept their fate, and pay the price for their misdeeds.\"\n\"They will be taught a lesson in power – the power of the people.\"\n\"If you are a true believer, be at the following location at 16.05 UTC on the 5th of November 3302.\"\n\"Novas A 6, Novas system.\"\nSecurity forces in the Novas system have urged the public to ignore the message.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:51:16Z","deprecated":false}
