An investigation is underway to identify the reasons for this drop in produce.”\n“To prevent a shortage of produce from impacting consumers, the IAA is reviewing options to enhance the fertility of cropland used for domestic consumption. These include newly proposed synthetic treatments that we hope will increase the sustainability of essential harvests.”\nThe situation was first highlighted during the Alliance Festival of Culture’s culinary week, when events in the Diso system were impacted by difficulties in sourcing fresh ingredients. Subsequent reports have indicated that these shortages are not unique to Allied space.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:18:11Z","deprecated":false}
