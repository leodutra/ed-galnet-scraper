According to Chloe Anders, a member of the surveillance team at Christian Dock, the mysterious vessel came within 10 kilometres of the station while performing what was described as a \"high-speed pass\":\n\"I saw it approach and assumed it was about to submit a docking request, but instead it just started circling the station. It had an unusual designation – \"S6: 7\" – so I tried hailing it, but there was no response. Then our sensors lit up. I couldn't believe it – the damned thing was scanning the station! I told the weapons team to stand by, but the next thing I knew, it was gone.\"\nAsked for her opinion of the vessel's purpose, Anders said: \"I know it sounds crazy, but when I saw it circling the station like that, the only thing I could think was that it was looking for something.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:52:50Z","deprecated":false}
