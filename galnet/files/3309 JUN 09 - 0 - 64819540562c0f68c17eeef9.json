What technologies were involved in their construction? We do not know. What exactly is a Titan’s hull comprised of? We cannot tell. How do the glowing openings on its superstructure work? We are not certain. Do they perform the same function as our docking bays? We can only speculate.”\n“How can we find these answers? By analysing whatever fragments and residues can be obtained directly from the Titans themselves. What military breakthroughs will result? What scientific marvels could be unlocked? What commercial opportunities might arise? We at Azimuth Biotech will discover all this and more.”\nAn editorial in the scientific journal The Empirical commented:\n“Aegis is leading the way on researching the Thargoid capital ships, as is to be expected. But even a cross-superpower agency does not have a monopoly on xenology. Azimuth, the organisation that once eclipsed Aegis entirely, remains determined to avoid falling under its rival’s shadow. Many other corporate and academic entities are also devoting resources to analysing the Titans. We are witnessing a kind of scientific gold rush, a race to mine nuggets of knowledge from these mysterious ships – one that carries a significant risk to the pilots wielding the tools.”","extractionDate":"2023-06-23T20:12:48Z","deprecated":false}
