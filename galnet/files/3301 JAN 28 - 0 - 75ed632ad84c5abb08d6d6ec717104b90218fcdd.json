George Fallside, the local Congressman, was present at the meeting. The Congressman, who was clearly distracted by social media at the time of the meeting, followed the mayor’s speech by offering his condolences to the Vice President’s family.\nThis was an hour after the VP’s death, but half an hour before the news of his death broke. The Congressman was not available for comment, but an aide has said -\n“Is it a big deal? He clearly misheard what was said.”\nOn ‘The Low Down’ they followed up by emphasising the Congressman’s links with the military, and in particularly his non-exec directorship of Core Dynamics."}
