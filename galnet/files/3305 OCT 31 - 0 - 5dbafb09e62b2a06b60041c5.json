Planetside farming communities in both systems are beginning to recover from severe crop damage.\nDr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture gave this statement to the media:\n“Thanks to the heroic efforts of the galactic community, we can confirm that the agronomic treatment performs superbly on infected farmland. The counteragent eliminated the mutated blight pathogen within hours, facilitating the recovery of living crops.”\n“Therefore, the IAA can confidently state that the immediate threat of food shortages has been alleviated, with food deliveries replenishing lost stocks. Mass production of the agronomic treatment has already begun, and it will soon be available across the galaxy to counteract the blight wherever it is found.”\nPilots who contributed to either of the initiatives can now collect their rewards from Shifnalport in the Diso system and Watson Station in the Orerve system, respectively.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:33:48Z","deprecated":false}
