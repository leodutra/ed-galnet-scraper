The research centre will focus on the study of newly catalogued lifeforms.\nDr Roy Casimir, chief researcher at the Holloway Bioscience Institute, held a press conference at the opening ceremony, and discussed the delays that followed a successful campaign to found the centre in February this year:\n“Our study of the lifeforms discovered over the past year formed the basis of the research centre’s designs. As the volume of scans provided by the galactic community continued to grow, it became apparent that we lacked the laboratory space required to study it all.” \n“As a result, the Holloway Bioscience Institute committed to several months of investment and redesign, to ensure that a wide variety of material could be analysed. We are confident that this decision will prove more than worthwhile, and our scientists are excited to work in this state-of-the-art facility.”\nThe Holloway Biology Centre is located in the Colonia system on Colonia 7 G.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:17:08Z","deprecated":false}
