Achilles themselves are unsure how this could have been possible, stating to reporters that the malicious agents would have required “incredibly sophisticated technology” to forge the appropriate passes.\nThe group were able to bypass the facility’s first checkpoint before the automated security robots identified them as a potential threat. The malicious agents apparently opened fire on the facility, preventing the robots from attempting a peaceful resolution.\nThere were no survivors of the conflict, and none of the malicious agents were identifiable in any active database.\nAchilles reports that they have increased security tenfold since the incident, and that this should be considered a testament to the quality of the security robots produced by their Robotics division.\nAchilles also reassures consumers that the incident has had no impact on Supercruise Overcharge module manufacturing.","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:26Z","deprecated":false}
