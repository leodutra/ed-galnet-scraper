Many companies withdrew their support even before the last shot was fired, and plans for Jupiter Division to become the movement’s central organisation have been abandoned.”\n“Sighs of relief were undoubtedly breathed through the corridors of power on Mars when this threat to the Federation’s democratic principles was defeated. And yet, despite Congress downplaying it and many Federal newsfeeds neglecting to cover the story, calls for a corporatocracy have not been completely silenced.”\n“Citizens who seek an alternative to voting for either Hudson or Winters are still attracted to the idea. Would corporate rule be more honest? Opinions vary, but many supporters claim ‘big business’ already possesses true power behind closed doors.”\n“It now seems that history will record this as a path not taken. With Jupiter Rochester imprisoned and Jupiter Division dissolved, replacement figureheads for the corporatist movement are unlikely to arise in time to preserve it.”","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:46:33Z","deprecated":false}
