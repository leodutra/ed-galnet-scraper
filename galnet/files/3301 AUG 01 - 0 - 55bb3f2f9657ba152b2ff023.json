He was hired by Sirius straight from college. He then quickly made his way up the ranks, and at the tender age of 35, Yong-Rui was made Vice President of Forecasting.\nHe has a proven track record in business, but has also demonstrated significant insight in the fuzzier elements and in particular how to provide effective government.
