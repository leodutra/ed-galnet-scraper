These will be used to replenish stocks used in the facility’s experimentation programme.\nDr Roy Casimir, chief researcher at the centre, expressed his gratitude:\n“These vital supplies mean that we can resume our studies on the incredible organisms that float through the void. Here at Holloway we’re making many breakthroughs in the field of xenobiology, some with intriguing commercial possibilities.”\nThe Holloway Bioscience Institute now plans to establish experimental habitats for vacuum lifeforms in the following systems:\nEol Prou PC-K c9-221\nEol Prou LW-L c8-99   \nEol Prou KW-L c8-301 \nEol Prou PC-K c9-154 \nPilots who contributed to this initiative can now collect their rewards from Jacques Station in the Colonia system."}
