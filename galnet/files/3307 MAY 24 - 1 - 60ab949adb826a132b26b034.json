This seemed to be a reaction to the huge quantities of Guardian artefacts currently stored within its cargo holds. \nCaptain Jacob Morales, the Alexandria’s commander, broadcast this message:\n“The Federal Navy has instructed us not to resume our scheduled journey to Sol or enter any system within the Federation. They’re treating us like a plague ship! I understand their concern that more Thargoids will follow us, but we have several thousand crewmembers who need to reach safe harbour.”\nA strategy was outlined by Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis:\n“We are attempting to clear the HIP 16538 system of Thargoid vessels, greatly aided by independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons. The megaship will then jump to a system with a minimal population, where we will offload its cargo.”\nAegis has reiterated that the option to jettison the Alexandria’s cargo is a last resort, since the Guardian artefacts are vital to its research programme and cost billions of credits to acquire.","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:46:57Z","deprecated":false}
