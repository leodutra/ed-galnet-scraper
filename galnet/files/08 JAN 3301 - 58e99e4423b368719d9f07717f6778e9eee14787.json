Stationing a warship at this small outpost can only be a distraction from their lack of enforcement of their own laws. \n“They think stationing a cruiser in Luluwala is a show of strength? A show of real strength would be to move against slavery in the Federation. Really they are being weak.”\nThere has been no comment from the Federal government as yet."}
