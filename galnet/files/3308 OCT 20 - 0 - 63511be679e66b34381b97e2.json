The perpetrator managed to flee the building before security could intervene.  \nDetails on the status of the victims have not been provided, but first responders to the scene found a digital calling card pinned to the host’s dressing room door. Police have authorised the publication of the card’s contents, which consists of a single word:\nTFZIRQRL\nThe word is thought to be encoded by a text cipher. It is hoped that by sharing the text, members of the public will be able to identify the perpetrator’s next move.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:15:42Z","deprecated":false}
