Deep Space Surveys also defended miners by placing a kill order on all wanted ships.\nCommander Michael Darkmoor of the Rock Rats stated:\n“The newly built astrophysics station will enable us to observe high-detail changes to the gravimetric field surrounding Sagittarius A*. We hope to better understand the deeper relationships between extreme gravity and multi-dimensional space.”\nThe Distant Worlds II exploration fleet will continue its journey across the galaxy, towards Beagle Point.\nThose who took part in the campaign can now collect their rewards from Explorer's Anchorage in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system."}
