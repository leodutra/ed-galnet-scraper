The act proved controversial, prompting accusations that the Alliance was attempting to lay claim to the organic structures on California Sector BA-A E6 4 of the California Sector BA-A E6 system.\nIn the wake of this development, the Alliance has announced plans to construct a new outpost on California Sector BA-A E6 4. According to an Alliance spokesperson, the station will serve as \"a centre for scientific study, supporting our ongoing research into the organic structures and meta-alloys\".\nIn support of this initiative, the Alliance has placed an open order for geological equipment, hazardous-environment suits and pesticides. 160 SOAR, which is coordinating the appeal, has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.\nThe campaign begins on the 13th of October 3302 and will run for two weeks. If final targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
