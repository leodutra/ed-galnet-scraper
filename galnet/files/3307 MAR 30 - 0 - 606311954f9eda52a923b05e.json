It is considered to be emergency legislation that replaces all previous laws regarding monitoring civilian activity and intercepting personal communications.\nVice President Archer, who personally drafted much of the new statute, announced:\n“This will allow the government to actively seek out any terrorist agents and sympathisers lurking within our communities. We will never again allow so many families and friends to be taken from us.”\nShadow President Felicia Winters responded:\n“Nobody wants another ‘Nine Martyrs’, and it’s vital that security is increased across the Federation. But this is an outrageous violation of civil liberties. For this administration to grant itself access to every citizen’s private life makes it resemble a dictatorial regime.”\nVP Archer later confirmed that he is already working with the heads of security services on practical applications of the new law. As a former director of the Federal Intelligence Agency, he is expected to make rapid progress.","extractionDate":"2021-03-30T23:33:24Z","deprecated":false}
