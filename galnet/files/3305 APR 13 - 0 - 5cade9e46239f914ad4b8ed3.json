Senator Zemina Torval has wasted no time in branding the princess ‘an ideological traitor’ for associating with isolationists.”\n“Family connections aside, Hadrian’s traditionalist views do not align with Aisling’s progressive approach. But he is young and inexperienced, with policies inherited from the extremist Imperator Mordanticus.”\n“Perhaps Aisling hopes that, by learning to adapt, this long-lost member of the Duval family may yet play a part on the galactic stage.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:37:51Z","deprecated":false}
