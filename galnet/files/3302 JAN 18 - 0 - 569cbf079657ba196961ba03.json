Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 694 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nSowiio Services\nMiphifa for Equality\nNew HIP 43296 Nationalists\nFriends of Wurun\nLP 131-66 Syndicate\nLords of Feng Du\nOnyayp Silver Family\nRoss 209 Fortune Organisation\nIxbakah Purple Transport Corp\nAlmar Emperor's Grace\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened.

A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:53:49Z","deprecated":false}
