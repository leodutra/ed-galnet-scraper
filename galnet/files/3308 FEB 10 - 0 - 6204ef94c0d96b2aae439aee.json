Our goal is to finish constructing the starports that were recently added to the route between the Colonia and Alcor systems.”\n“For the first week, we require deliveries of Coffee, Emergency Power Cells, Geological Equipment and Liquid Oxygen to Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. If we receive sufficient commodities, we can add Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics to all six stations.”\n“Everyone at Brewer Corporation was impressed by the galactic community’s dedication to improving the travel corridor to the Colonia region. For this week’s initiative, contributing pilots have the opportunity to be rewarded with a generous number of credits. In subsequent weeks, we will be offering a variety of additional rewards.”\n“Following feedback from our shareholders, we also plan to install beacons to recognise the major contributors to all phases of the Colonia Bridge project. The top ten contributors of every past and upcoming Colonia Bridge initiative will be listed on these beacons to immortalise the names of these pilots.”\nThe Colonia Bridge starports currently offer rearm, refuel and repair services as well as basic commodity trading. The second, third and fourth weeks of this phase will focus on adding further services.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:12:30Z","deprecated":false}
