Fortunately, we were able to defeat them before they could do serious damage.”\n“There is no doubt that the mercenaries’ primary target was Phoenix Base. We suspect that this incident is connected to an attempted raid on the base that was repelled a few weeks ago.”\nLi Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, addressed the incident:\n“I’m relieved that the attack was foiled, but this only demonstrates how precarious Ram Tah’s situation is. I urge him to accept my offer to work with the Sirius Corporation – not only for his own safety, but also to safeguard future Guardian-human technologies.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:46:46Z","deprecated":false}
