The organisation has promised to reward pilots who deliver domestic appliances, clothing and consumer technology to its base of operations at Vancouver Ring.\nA spokesperson for the organisation gave a brief statement to the media:\n\"Half of my suppliers have let me down and I've got investors breathing down my neck. I don't care how you do it â€“ just get me those goods!\"\nThe campaign begins on the 24th of November 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
