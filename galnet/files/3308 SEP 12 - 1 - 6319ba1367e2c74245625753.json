The Thargoids’ victory in HIP 22460 seems to have caused unprecedented excitement among the cultists. At present, there is no evidence that they pose any danger to the public. However, we are concerned by a recent increase in citizens abandoning their conventional lifestyles to join the cult.”\n“We have also noted the rising popularity of a civil movement that advocates diplomatic relations with the Thargoids. This rhetoric is being promoted by several high-profile media figures. There is currently no known connection between these ‘xeno-peace’ supporters and the Far God cult, but both groups are being closely observed for potential criminality.”\nDr Alfred Ulyanov, the leading academic authority on the Far God faith, submitted his observations to The Federal Times: \n“Recent events in HIP 22460 have galvanised the cultists, but also seem to have triggered an element of discord among some. Worshippers are abandoning the orthodox hive-chapels and pledging themselves to the True Chapters sect, where the First Apostle is being hailed as a holy messenger of the Far God. My contacts inform me that the Testament megaship has despatched scouts to locate a more permanent home, likely to accommodate a wave of new converts.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:17:23Z","deprecated":false}
