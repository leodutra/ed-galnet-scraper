Pilots from remote settlements throughout human space have claimed that the latest TrakMark tyres are not fit for purpose, resulting in damage to SRVs after just a few kilometres. It's up to the Buckyball Racing Club to prove them wrong.\nThe race, which starts in the Cernobog system, runs from the 27th of August to the 4th of September.\nCommander Alec Turner\nBuckyball Race Organiser","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:44:53Z","deprecated":false}
