Hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign by sweeping the Pleiades Nebula and delivering the resultant astronomical data to Pre Logistics Support Gamma in the Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-5 system.\nThe organisation's spokesperson released the following statement:\n\"The Federation extends its gratitude to those who supported this operation. If there are other crash sites like the one discovered in AB-W B2-4, it is imperative that we know. That's why this data is so important.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Pre Logistics Support Gamma in the Pleiades Sector IH-V C2-5 system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:42:12Z","deprecated":false}
