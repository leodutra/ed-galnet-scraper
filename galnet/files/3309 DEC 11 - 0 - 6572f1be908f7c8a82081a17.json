Following concerns that Utopia was involved, Aegis shared these designs with the commune to confirm that there was no connection with their Sim-Archive technology.\nPranav Antal recently sent a message to Aegis, which has been made public with Utopia’s permission:\n“After studying the designs intensively, our neurosmiths have gained some insights into the Nemesis Failsafe. Salvation’s unique knowledge of Guardian energy particles and their applications exceeds even our understanding. But we have formulated a theory about what happened when the ‘Nemesis protocol’ was activated aboard the Bright Sentinel megaship, shortly before its destruction in HIP 22460.”\n“I would like to discuss this matter in person with Seo Jin-ae. Her unique experience with Salvation’s methods and independent research into his character may help me resolve some remaining questions.”\nVox Galactica’s science correspondent Leon Banerjee reported:\n“The Nemesis Failsafe question is generally viewed with scepticism, if not outright mockery, among leading exoneurologists. Nobody disputes Salvation’s expertise at weaponising Guardian artefacts, but few believe that a living mind could be converted into electromagnetic pulses, even using alien technology.”\n“Azimuth Biotech is also dismissive, not just about the science but the very idea that Salvation may have survived. Torben Rademaker has referred to it as ‘inappropriate and disrespectful to the memory of our founder Caleb Wycherley.’ Nevertheless, Aegis has agreed to transport Seo Jin-ae to meet Pranav Antal, if she accepts his invitation.”","extractionDate":"2024-02-08T21:50:04Z","deprecated":false}
