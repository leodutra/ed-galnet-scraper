Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 472 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nPeople's Kehperi People's Party\nLabour of Ghimr\nHIP 114472 Limited\nOrishpucho Jet Hand Gang\nTiburnat Gold Society\nIota Pictoris A Syndicate\t\nVelingai Blue Society\nHIP 60902 Fortune Company\nCartel of Diaguandri\nHIP 20342 Jet Syndicate\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing."}
