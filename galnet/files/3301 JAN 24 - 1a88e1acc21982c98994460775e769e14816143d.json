You cannot spoil our happiness. We are still cool. We have more friends that you realise. And now we are rich!”\nDue to a quirk of Federal Law, the new strain does not fall under the statue banning sale of Onionhead, as Lucan Onionhead is a different strain. Federal Labs are reported to be rushing the tests through in order to make it illegal as soon as their processes allow."}
