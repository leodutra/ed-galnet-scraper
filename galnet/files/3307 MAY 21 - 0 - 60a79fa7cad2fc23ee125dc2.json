The content undoubtedly arranges the starport bombings, but its source is inconclusive. It now seems highly plausible that his identity was faked by the NMLA.”\nHadrian Duval made an announcement via the Paresa News Network:\n“There can no longer be any doubt that the NMLA planted a false trail in order to incriminate us. They aim to slay every Duval and demolish Imperial traditions, a goal that the Federation is clearly happy to support.”\n“Lady Astrid and I are deeply grateful to the Nova Navy, and all the other pilots who helped to defend our honour.”\nThe Federal Diplomatic Corps confirmed that the League of Mandu, which was defeated by Nova Imperium, will withdraw from the Paresa system but made no reference to ACT’s report.\nPraetor Leo Magnus, head of security for Nova Imperium and a former IISS officer, has been seconded to ACT. He will serve as a replacement for the deceased Captain Niamh Seutonia.","extractionDate":"2021-07-12T21:46:35Z","deprecated":false}
