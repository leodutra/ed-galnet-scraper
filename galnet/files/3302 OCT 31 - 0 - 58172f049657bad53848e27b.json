Once the find was made public, pilots from across the galaxy flocked to investigate the site.\nAlthough a formal survey of the ruins has not yet been conducted, speculation is rife that they are of non-human origin. Images of the site, which show mysterious structures and a series of complex earthworks, appear to support this hypothesis.\nThe discovery of the ruins is only one of a number of remarkable finds made over the past few years. The Unknown Artefacts, Unknown Probes, the so-called organic structures and the crash site in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system have piqued the curiosity of the entire galactic community. But the relationship between these discoveries – if any – has yet to be determined.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:00:55Z","deprecated":false}
