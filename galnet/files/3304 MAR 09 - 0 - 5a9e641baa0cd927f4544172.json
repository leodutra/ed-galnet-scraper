A new asteroid base would allow us to support large ships, such as the Anaconda and Imperial Cutter, and allow us to compete with other refineries in the sector.”\nThe organisation has placed an open order for various commodities, and has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list to ensure that those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely. Pilots who contribute to the initiative will be generously rewarded.\nThe campaign begins on 8th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
