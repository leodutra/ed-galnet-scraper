It has placed an open order for various commodities for use in the construction.\nCommander Raijiin, head of the organisation, elaborated on the nature of the campaign.\n“We need quantities of palladium, titanium and robotics, and we encourage all able and willing pilots to assist us.”\n“We are expecting the initiative to attract agitators, but security in the system has been increased and many of our own wings are patrolling the trade lanes, to ensure no crime goes unpunished.”\nThe Candy Crew Guild has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested commodities to Bella Port in the Irusan system.\nThe campaign begins on the 28th of September 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:42:33Z","deprecated":false}
