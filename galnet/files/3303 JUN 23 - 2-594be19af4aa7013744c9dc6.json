I will be hosting another of these events in a few weeks for one of my most important clients, and am therefore seeking rare commodities from across the galaxy. But it is not only food I require – I am in need of a wealth of exotic goods, all of which will contribute to overall ambience.”\nThe appeal is being financed by Dr Swainn’s corporate partner, Lave Incorporated, which has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested commodities to Lave Station.\nThe campaign begins on the 22nd June 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
