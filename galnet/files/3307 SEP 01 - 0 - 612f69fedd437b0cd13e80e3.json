President Hudson should be fearful that history might view him as the Federation’s first dictator.”\nSenator Denton Patreus’s comments were featured by Eye on Achenar:\n“Of course the Federation’s factions are turning against it. The arrogance and corruption of its leaders will inevitably cause it to rot from within. We can expect to see it dissolve into chaos before long.”\nFederal newsfeed Sol Today published a response by Vice President Jerome Archer:\n“Both the Alliance and Empire have chosen a reactionary approach to terrorism, whereas the Federation has made great strides in intelligence-gathering and preventative action. I’m confident that the Proactive Detection Bureau will come to be accepted as one of the galaxy’s greatest innovations.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:25:31Z","deprecated":false}
