Minister Aaron Whyte, its elected leader, announced:\n“Not every individual within the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid is an NMLA activist. We have the right to offer asylum to protect innocents from persecution, just as the Federation protected us when we were refugees.”\nThe Empire has officially demanded that the Neo-Marlinists be apprehended, with Senator Patreus claiming “The Landgrave of Mudhrid is a traitor and a war criminal.”\nBoth the Alliance and Federation have likewise insisted on their arrest. However, Shadow President Winters reminded Congress that the Marlinist Charter grants their systems the same legal powers of asylum as the Federation.\nThe Marlinist Parliament has declared an emergency situation. First Minister Fairfax called for a discussion of options, while Ministers Amrita Ross and Tamsin Taylor urged cooperation with the Empire.","extraction_date":"2021-04-18T19:32:57Z","deprecated":false}
