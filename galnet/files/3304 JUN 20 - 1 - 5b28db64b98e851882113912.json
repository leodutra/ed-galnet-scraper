And Colonia is the embodiment of that spirit, the farthest-flung outpost of civilisation.”\n“That’s why I want to support it by funding the development of new shipyards. Every planetary port in the region, bar Colonia Hub, will soon be able to offer pilots the support services they need. It’s my way of celebrating a youth filled with poverty and danger, by giving a boost to the next generation of explorers.”\nBryanna Blanco, a financial journalist for The Federal Times, also published a statement:\n“Obviously this is tremendous news for Colonia and all those operating within the region. The timing of Rackham’s donation is curious, however, coming as it does shortly before a company-wide audit. Having such a colossal sum placed beyond the reach of tax officials will certainly help that old pirate – and his crew of accountants – sleep better at night.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:10:28Z","deprecated":false}
