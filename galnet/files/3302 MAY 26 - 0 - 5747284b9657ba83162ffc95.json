But the revelry has come at a cost, as it seems 63 G. Capricorni is now in the grip of a system-wide hangover.\nA member of staff at Skvortsov Orbital said: \"Those Diamond Frogs really know how to throw a party. Seriously, I've never seen anything like it. At one point, the security chief was dancing on a table and screaming about wanting to be a showgirl.\"\nThe starport's chief of security declined to comment, although rumours that he has resigned his position to fulfil his secret ambitions remain unsubstantiated. His office issued the following statement:\n\"The celebrations were a great success, but now it's time to clean up. We are therefore asking independent pilots to deliver hazardous environment suits, water purifiers and coffee to help the system get back on its feet.\"\nThe Diamond Frogs have once again stepped in, promising to reward pilots who deliver the much-needed commodities to Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G. Capricorni system. The campaign begins on the 26th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:04:09Z","deprecated":false}
