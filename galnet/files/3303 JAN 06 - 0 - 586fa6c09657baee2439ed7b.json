The mysterious craft subjected the pilot's vessel to some kind of scan before departing, at which point the hapless Commander's ship returned to life.\nCommentators reviewing the pilot's recording of the event have noted strong similarities between the mysterious craft and the shipwrecks found in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 and the HIP 17862 system.\nIs the ship a Thargoid vessel? This is the question many are asking.\nWe will continue to bring you up-to-the-minute updates on this story.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:59:39Z","deprecated":false}
