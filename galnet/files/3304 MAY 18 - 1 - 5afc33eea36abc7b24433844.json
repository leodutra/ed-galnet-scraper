With these, we can evaluate Colonia’s true potential.”\nThe campaign is being run by the Colonia Co-operative, one of Colonia’s partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver microresources to Foster Terminal in the Coeus system.\nThe campaign begins on the 17th of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:49:13Z","deprecated":false}
