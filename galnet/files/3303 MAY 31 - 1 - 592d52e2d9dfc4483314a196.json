The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nBrotherhood of LP 98-132\nNgaliba Blue Camorra\nLords of Ngaliba\nAlpha Centauri Gold Brotherhood\nMovement for 11 Cephei Worker's Party\nOrishpucho Jet Hand Gang\nAleutes Bureau\nLeaders of Santal\nIndines Commodities\nBakara Empire Party\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished.
