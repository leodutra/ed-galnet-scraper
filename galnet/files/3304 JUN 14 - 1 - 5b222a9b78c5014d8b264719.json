Scores of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Lave Station, thereby allowing the network to broadcast its annual conference to the entire galaxy. A rival campaign from the Lave Jet Family was unable to destabilise the Lave Radio initiative, despite also receiving the support of independent pilots.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, one of the organisers released a statement:\n“The signal is spreading. We would like to extend our gratitude to the galactic community for making this possible.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lave Station in the Lave system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:09:59Z","deprecated":false}
