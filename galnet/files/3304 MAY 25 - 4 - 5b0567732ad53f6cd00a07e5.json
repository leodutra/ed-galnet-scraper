A vacancy was created when Fleet Admiral Tulimaq Buchanan was assassinated by the League of Reparation.\nMcAllister, who hails from the Lave system and who is now in charge of its navy, is the youngest person ever to be appointed to the Council. She is also the most junior in rank, having bypassed several other candidates from the ADF admiralty, which has caused some controversy.\nAdmiral George Varma defended the appointment:\n“Despite her relative youth, McAllister is one of our most decorated combat veterans and a master strategist. This makes her an excellent choice to help defend the Alliance.”\nThe newly promoted Rear Admiral McAllister made a characteristically brief statement:\n“I’m grateful to the Council for this honour. As well as my naval duties, I will be aiding efforts against the terrorist group responsible for my predecessor’s death.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:15:21Z","deprecated":false}
