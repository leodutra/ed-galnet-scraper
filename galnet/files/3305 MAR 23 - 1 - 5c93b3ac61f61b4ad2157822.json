I believe that Gavaris used her knowledge of Rackham’s past to blackmail her way into his organisation, and is now challenging for ownership by eliminating his loyal supporters.”\n“The Federal Times has published many similar revelations about ‘Calico Zack’ over the years, yet no criminal investigation has been established. Perhaps this time the authorities will investigate before Gavaris’s vendetta escalates further, potentially endangering civilian lives.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:14:39Z","deprecated":false}
