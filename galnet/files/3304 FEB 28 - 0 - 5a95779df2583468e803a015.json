He has issued the following statement:\n“The artefacts recently delivered to me have been subjected to intense molecular analysis. As a result, I have deduced the possibility of Guardian sites in three specific systems: Col 173 Sector QU-O d6-25, HD 63154 and Synuefe EU-Q c21-10.”\n“I urge the galactic community to investigate these systems, where I believe we may find further traces of the Guardians’ ancient civilisation. I appreciate that this could be a wild goose chase, but data from such sites – if they exist – would be extremely valuable.”\nRam Tah has asked that any data be delivered to him at Phoenix Base in the Meene system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:06:58Z","deprecated":false}
