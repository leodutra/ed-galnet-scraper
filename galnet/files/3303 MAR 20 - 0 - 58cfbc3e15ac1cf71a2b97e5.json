When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nCoalition of Ngaliba\nAutocracy of Phi Gruis \nPartnership of LHS 2819\nLeague of Ross 1015\nAtroan Gold Gang\nHuaich Independents\nLiberate Ceos\nG 239-25 Alliance\nPeople's Perendi Future\nWirangu Life Co\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending."}
