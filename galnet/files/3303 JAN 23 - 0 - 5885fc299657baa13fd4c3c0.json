Hundreds of independent pilots responded to the appeal, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Felice Dock, the campaign's centre of operations.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Ram Tah released a brief statement.\n\"I am hugely grateful to the galactic community for its support. It is my hope that this data will allow us to unlock the monolith network and discover further Guardian sites.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:45:32Z","deprecated":false}
