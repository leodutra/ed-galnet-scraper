The company that puts forward the most convincing proposal will secure the contract.”\nThe companies in question are Neomedical Industries, which supplies Alliance and independent systems, and the Vandermeer Corporation, which operates exclusively within Federal space. Both have requested advanced medicines, computer components and auto fabricators for the construction of nanomed manufacturing plants.\nDeliveries for Neomedical Industries should be made to Alignak Jet Legal and Co at Piserchia Port in Alignak while shipments for the Vandermeer Corporation should be delivered to the Liberals of Kuma at Elion Dock in Kuma.\nThe competing initiatives begin on the 24th of January 3305. If either campaign meets its target earlier than planned, that campaign will end immediately."}
