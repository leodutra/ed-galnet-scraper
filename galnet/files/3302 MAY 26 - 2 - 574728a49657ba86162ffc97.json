Recent reports indicate that agitators have been attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.\nTo counter this threat, Ngolibardu Electronics Solutions has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Ngolibardu system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Vernadsky Port.\nThe campaign begins on the 26th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:04:09Z","deprecated":false}
