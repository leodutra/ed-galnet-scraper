The Polahukuna Raiders, and those like them, need to learn that their actions have consequences. The Federation will not sit idly by and let the infections of chaos and anarchy spread and fester.\"\nThe Admiral went on to say that he would reveal plans as to the nature of the Federation's foray into Polahukuna shortly."}
