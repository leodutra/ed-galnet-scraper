The credits were then sent to an account in the HR 706 system. \nSources close to the investigation informed GalNet that the clue was actually uncovered several days ago, but certain groups within the Empire had been slow in granting the Princess’s fleet unrestricted access to the system.\nWhatever the truth, Princess Lavigny-Duval has finally sent word for her fleet to begin dismantling all crime syndicates operating in HR 706. It is believed that Emperor’s Grace has lodged a formal complaint with the Senate over Senator Lavigny’s incursion into their system, but so far the complaint has gone unanswered.\nImperial citizens interested in aiding the Princess with her investigation are being asked to report for active duty aboard Laming Orbital.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:49:05Z","deprecated":false}
