It is also expected that a loss of public support will reduce stability within systems where Winters has authority.\nPilots who supported President Hudson can now collect their rewards from Gresley Dock in the Nanomam system.\nPilots who supported Shadow President Winters can now collect their rewards from Ito Orbital in the Rhea system.","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:46:40Z","deprecated":false}
