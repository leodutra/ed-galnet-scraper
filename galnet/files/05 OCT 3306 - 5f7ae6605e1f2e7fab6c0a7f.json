Several jury members nodded when the prosecutor called for the death sentence, should the accused be found guilty of slaughtering hundreds.”\n“The judge was about to begin her summation, when Mr Webster’s defence counsel announced that the defendant now wished to change his plea to guilty and make a full confession in return for clemency, claiming that he had acted on ‘orders from the top’.”\n“There was much discussion between the judge and legal representatives. Eventually it was agreed that the trial would be suspended while Mr Webster’s testimony was taken by the Federal Intelligence Agency, and then a suitable course of action would follow.”\nThe Federal Attorney’s Office stated that a decision on resuming the trial is expected within a few days."}
