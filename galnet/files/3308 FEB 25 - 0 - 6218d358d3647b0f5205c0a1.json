This was triggered by the megacorp’s unpopular attempt to establish a presence in the system as an anti-xeno defence partner.\nCouncillor Nakato Kaine led a motion to censure against Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, which successfully passed with a plurality of votes after some abstentions. The strongly-worded reprimand focused on ‘disregarding the Alliance’s principles by unilaterally forcing cooperation with Sirius Corporation’.\nAfter Mahon formally accepted the reprimand, Councillor Kaine addressed the Assembly:\n“This body does not have the right to govern its member systems without their consent. The strategic defence pact must become civil legislation rather than a military contract, so it can be passed as law.”\n“I call upon Li Yong-Rui to agree to these terms, or else to abandon the pact and remove Sirius Corporation’s forces from the Alioth, Arimpox, Di Jian and Leesti systems.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:23:39Z","deprecated":false}
