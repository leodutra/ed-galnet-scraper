Over sixty thousand people were killed and twice as many wounded by powerful explosives that delivered a caustic enzyme payload.\nThe Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army is an extremist paramilitary group that is dedicated to reforming Marlin Duval’s original republican government. Prior to these bombings, it had only performed minor strikes with low casualties.\nThe NMLA’s terror campaign grew to encompass all three superpowers with the Nine Martyrs attacks in March 3307. It also led to supporters of Marlinism fleeing from the Empire as refugees, eventually resettling in the Marlinist Colonies.\nPrincess Aisling Duval paid respects to the victims during a memorial ceremony at her palace on Emerald. She also spoke of her father Prince Harold Duval, who was assassinated by the NMLA shortly after the bombings.\nMessages of condolence have been sent by President Zachary Hudson, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval and First Minister Octavia Volkov. All vowed to continue contributing resources to ACT, which recently shut down many terrorist cells. Coupled with the loss of its political wing, the NMLA threat may finally be diminishing.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:24:41Z","deprecated":false}
