Many starports have begun placing orders for the material as a hedge against potential malfunctions.\nVernon Trask, lead engineer at Bauschinger City, said: \"Some stations have been defunct for nearly a year because of those corrosive Artefacts. We can't afford to be out of commission that long.\"\n\"Quite a few stations in the Empire have open orders for meta-alloys, including Bauschinger. We're hoping to get ahead of this techno-plague before it bites us.\"\nThis 'meta-alloy rush' has alarmed conservationists and researchers concerned about the future of the barnacles.\n\"We know so little about the barnacles,\" said Dr Elana Lorax, a noted xenobiologist. \"We don't know how they grow, how long they live or how they create meta-alloys. If the exploitation continues at this rate, we may never know.\"\nCommander Corrigendum","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:37:58Z","deprecated":false}
