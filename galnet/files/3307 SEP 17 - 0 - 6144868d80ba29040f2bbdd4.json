Delta Pavonis was one of the original signatories of the Federal Accord in 2242, but has recently been governed by an independent autocracy.\nYuri Grom himself is present, having arrived on the megaship Indomitable. Grom was once a respected admiral in the Federal Navy, before defecting with huge numbers of ships and followers. They established the independent EG Union, which he presides over as a military dictatorship.\nThe rival delegation is led by Ambassador Delphine Dumont of the Federal Diplomatic Corps. They were transported on the Freedom’s Foundation megaship courtesy of Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar, which formerly controlled the system. The ambassador invited newsfeeds to witness her initial introduction to Yuri Grom, who seemed slightly taken aback by her warm greeting.\nGrand Duke Simion Petrescu, ruler of the Autocracy of Delta Pavonis, told attending journalists:\n“The conference will take place in Kessler City on Reagan’s Legacy, where our distinguished guests will enjoy our famous hospitality. I look forward to learning more about their respective proposals.”\nThis is the first time that the Federation has diplomatically engaged with Yuri Grom. Political observers noted that this tactful approach may be due to several Federal factions recently declaring independence.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:16:21Z","deprecated":false}
