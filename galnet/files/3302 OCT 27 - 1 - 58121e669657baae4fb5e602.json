The materials will be used to construct an outpost on California Sector BA-A E6 4.\nIn a statement, the spokesperson said:\n\"We are immeasurably grateful to the galactic community for its support. The outpost on California Sector BA-A E6 4 will serve as a base for research into the barnacles, allowing us to further our understanding of these fascinating structures. Construction will begin in a matter of weeks.\"\nBut the campaign has not been without controversy, with some asserting that the outpost represents an attempt to claim ownership of the organic structures on California Sector BA-A E6 4.\nPilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:51:45Z","deprecated":false}
