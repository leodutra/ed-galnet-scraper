Many local system authorities have renamed landmarks and buildings in his honour, and a few have commissioned architects and artists to create new memorials in local capitals. The grandest of these designs has been commissioned by the Facece Empire Party on Topaz, featuring a modernist interpretation of the late Emperor sat atop a triumphal arch in the capital's main square. A statement released by the Facece Empire Party reads: \"This minimalist sculpture will represent the spirit of the late Emperor, and all those who went before him, as a caretaker watching over the people\".\nPilotsâ€™ bars have become more akin to literary salons of late, as commanders attempt to unravel the mystery behind Brendan Paul Darius' motives, and determine the existence of a possible mastermind behind the shocking assassination.\nPerhaps the greatest tributes have come from the ordinary Imperial citizenry.
