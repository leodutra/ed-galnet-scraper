Pilots also provided tissue samples extracted from the caustic generators inside each Maelstrom, which are a vital component of these modules.  Manufacturing bases have now been established, allowing stocks of the caustic sink launcher to reach the public market. \nDr Maximo Fonseca, head of xenological research at Gateway Laboratories, published a statement on behalf of Aegis:\n“The Thargoids have developed powerful defences to prevent their enemies reaching the heart of the Maelstroms. The dangerously caustic gas clouds are an effective deterrent, and have sadly claimed the lives of many intrepid pilots.”\n“So, the caustic sink launcher is an exciting breakthrough that will both save lives and facilitate vital data recovery. Now that ships can survive for longer within the clouds, the acquisition and study of tissue samples and caustic shards should increase. The next priority for Aegis is to study the massive energy surges that prevent access to the inner region of a Maelstrom.”\nAegis has invited all pilots who took part in the delivery initiative to collect their rewards from the Orunmilla in the Duamta system.","extractionDate":"2023-06-23T20:12:15Z","deprecated":false}
