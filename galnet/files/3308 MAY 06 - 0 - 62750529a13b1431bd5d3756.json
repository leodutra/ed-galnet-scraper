The starport names and locations are Fairfax Legacy in the Hyades Sector SU-C a14-1 system, and Ackwada Monument in the Hyades Sector LX-T c3-30 system.\nThe Marlinist Parliament welcomed the new starports, stating that they “will lay strong foundations for increased commerce with the interstellar community”.\nAs a result of a recent diplomatic arrangement, two million Marlinist refugees have been offered transport from the Alliance to the colony systems. They are being processed and granted citizenship at the new starports.\nA campaign to rename the two existing starports, Stillman Hub and Tilman Point, was discouraged by Sirius Corporation. These stations were constructed when the megacorp first established the colonies in 3306, as a way to defuse tensions between the Empire and the Federation. \nHowever, Sirius Corporation did not object to new designations for the original eight Marlinist systems. These are expected to become official in the coming weeks.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:14:58Z","deprecated":false}
