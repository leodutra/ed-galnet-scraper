Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 479 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\n14 i Orionis Jet Camorra\n30 Ceti Purple Clan\n38 Lyncis Drug Empire\n64 Arietis Jet General Solutions\nAbukunin Corporation\nAegilakan Crimson Gang\nAleumoxii Purple Brotherhood\nAllied Brani First\nAllied Kamadhenu Nationalists\nAlpha Centauri Advanced Corp.\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:31:06Z","deprecated":false}
