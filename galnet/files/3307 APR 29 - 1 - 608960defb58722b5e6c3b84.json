Pilots then transported these to the Delphi system for analysis.\nProfessor Alba Tesreau made this announcement:\n“Everyone at Aegis is thankful for the impressive effort made by the galactic community. If we can gain new insights into Guardian technology from these samples, then funding and resources for our work may continue.”\nAegis has agreed to pursue the development of weaponry and defences that might prove more effective against the Thargoids. However, as yet the research is in its early stages and there are no signs of imminent breakthroughs.\nPilots who delivered Guardian artefacts can now collect their rewards from Aegis Research at the Alexandria megaship in the Delphi system.","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:46:11Z","deprecated":false}
