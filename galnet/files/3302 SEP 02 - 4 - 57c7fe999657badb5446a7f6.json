It read: \"The headerless octal number - it is distance compared to Merope!\"\nA list of data followed, obtained by monitoring the Unknown Probe in different systems. The octal number was shown to steadily decrease as Commander Wace neared the permit-locked Col 70 Sector.\nIn an impressive display of field mathematics, Commander Wace pin-pointed the Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 system as the Probe's 'zero point'. Unfortunately, the Canonn is prevented from further investigation of the system by the permit lock of the Col 70 Sector.\nCommander Han Zen","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:44:19Z","deprecated":false}
