The last thousand years of human history have been shaped by our combined ability to travel through the stars in search of a better future. \nYet what has humanity done with this precious gift? The same thing we’ve always done. We wasted it.\nGreed and war run rampant throughout the galaxy, and the concept of freedom has become nothing more than a buzzword spewed by people who have never known it.\nThe Alliance knows there’s a better way, but to prove it they need YOUR help.\nFor the next two weeks, the Alliance of Independent Systems will be collecting exploration data for an exciting new colonisation initiative due to launch later this year. \nCommanders interested in working with the Alliance should deliver any information they’ve uncovered in relation to potential colony sites to Purple Power Interstellar aboard Ziemkiewicz Ring in Tsu.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:27:19Z","deprecated":false}
