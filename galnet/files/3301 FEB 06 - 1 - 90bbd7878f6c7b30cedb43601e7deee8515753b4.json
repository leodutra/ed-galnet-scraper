To that end, Senator Patreus, in association with Senator Torval, has generously offered to provide free training for all debt- ridden citizens of Durius  willing to be retrained for work as Imperial Slaves to clear their remaining debt.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:33:52Z","deprecated":false}
