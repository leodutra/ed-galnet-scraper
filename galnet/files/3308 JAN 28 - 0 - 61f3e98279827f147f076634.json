The new stations are:\nZerreiss Station in the Pru Euq WO-D b53-8 system\nHelgrind Gateway in the NGC 6530 Sector ZE-X b2-0 system\nVladmir McDoogle's Triumph in the Flyiedge VN-W c4-51 system\nCanonn Complex in the Prua Phoe MI-B b17-5 system\nVenatores Hub in the Blua Eaec WW-E c14-1293 system\nPromium Relay in the Eoch Flyuae QK-E d12-2118 system\nAt present the starports are not fully operational and only provide rearm, refuel and repair services. Basic commodity trading has also been established to accommodate pilots selling construction materials and to supply tritium fuel.\nA fourth phase of the Colonia Bridge project is scheduled to begin on the 10th of February, which will aim to complete construction and add a broader range of facilities.\nBrewer Corporation was able to meet all of its targets for phase three due to the considerable amount of raw materials delivered by the galactic community. The names of the new starports were selected by those pilots who made the greatest contributions to the initiative.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:28:15Z","deprecated":false}
