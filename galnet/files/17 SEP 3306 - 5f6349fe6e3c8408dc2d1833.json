A state funeral at the Hall of Martyrs is being arranged and there will be a period of mourning, as is customary for esteemed members of the Imperial Family. There will be opportunities for all citizens to honour Harold’s memory in an appropriate manner.”\nPrincess Aisling Duval, Harold’s daughter, appeared uncharacteristically distressed when she gave a brief statement to the media:\n“It’s a huge loss to us all that… I’m sorry… I can’t believe this has happened. He can’t be gone! I used to have some sympathy for the Marlinists, but now they… they took him from us. They took my daddy.”\nThe NMLA also attacked starports in the Cemiess, Gabjaujis, LHS 4031 and Rabh systems. \nThe Empire is now on heightened alert, and the Senate has approved new counter-terrorism initiatives proposed by Senator Denton Patreus."}
