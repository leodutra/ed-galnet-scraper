Land enrichment systems, animal monitors, aquaponic systems and marine equipment were delivered to Ocrinox's Orbiter over the past week, allowing construction of a megaship where manatees will be farmed.\nWith the initiative at an end, Progenitor Selena Conley of the Libertas Cooperative issued the following statement:\n“The people of Munshin, and our partners at Munshin Manatee Meat, extend the warmest of thanks to all pilots who supported our project. Increased production of manatee meat will give a much-needed boost to the Munshin system’s economy.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Ocrinox's Orbiter in the Munshin system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:55:13Z","deprecated":false}
