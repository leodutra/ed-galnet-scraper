I hope the Pleiades Resource Enterprise is prepared for a fight.\"\nThe Imperial Inquisition has asked all Empire-aligned pilots to travel to Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-16 and help repel the Federal offensive. Similarly, the Pleiades Resource Enterprise has issued a call to arms to all Federation-aligned fighters.\nThe Pleiades Resource Enterprise has set out a week-long operation to take control of the system, which will begin on the 11th of August 3302.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:53:04Z","deprecated":false}
