Long-range reconnaissance has revealed a well-defended operation, and approaches are greeted with patrol ships and warning shots.\nMeanwhile, shares in Wreaken have gone up by five per cent as speculation grips the financial markets. Some commentators believe this is directly linked to Admiral Denton Patreus's recent comments concerning the London Treaty.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:26:53Z","deprecated":false}
