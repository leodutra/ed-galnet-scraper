We have been promised that a wide range of artistic achievements, entertainment and history will be highlighted.”\n“Naturally, the Tribune will be offering in-depth coverage over the course of the festival.”\nThe prime minister was visibly pleased to introduce the Alliance Festival of Culture, describing it as “a celebration to lift citizens’ spirits in these challenging times”. It has been speculated that Mahon is hoping to move forward from the recent political scandals involving Gibson Kincaid.\nThe centrepiece of the opening ceremony was a tribute to Megan Madigan, widely considered one of the most significant visual artists of the late 33rd Century. Her most famous work, titled ‘Penance Street’, was tragically lost in transit sixty years ago. The much-loved painting was honoured by modern reinterpretations from dozens of Lave’s finest artists."}
