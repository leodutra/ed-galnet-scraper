The Senator has also authorised a number of Empire-aligned factions to reward pilots who join the fight against Emperor's Dawn. The insurgents, meanwhile, have responded in kind, promising to reward pilots who help repel the Imperials.\nSome news feeds have speculated that the Senator's actions are designed not only to maintain the pressure on Emperor's Dawn, but also to minimise the chances of the insurgents disrupting Arissa Lavigny-Duval's forthcoming coronation.\nThe outcome of the battle is by no means certain, but one thing is for sure â€“ the wider conflict between the Empire and Emperor's Dawn is far from over.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:40:08Z","deprecated":false}
