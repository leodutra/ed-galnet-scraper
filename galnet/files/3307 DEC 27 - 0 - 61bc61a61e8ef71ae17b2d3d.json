As with the three previous broadcasts, they were designed to invite independent pilots to locate a series of concealed caches.\nOur technical teams have identified the method by which the criminal known as the Winking Cat inserted unapproved articles into GalNet’s publication network. Security protocols have been heavily reinforced and we are confident that no further intrusions will take place.\nGalNet offers formal apologies to all members of the Pilots’ Federation for this disruption.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:12:53Z","deprecated":false}
