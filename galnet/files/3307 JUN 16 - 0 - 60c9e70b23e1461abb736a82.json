The people of the Alliance should have a direct mandate to determine their leader by casting individual votes.”\nPolitical journalist Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune:\n“Although Kaine stopped short of claiming that Mahon’s victory was achieved fraudulently, the Assembly took a dim view of this attempt at electoral overhaul. Some council members accused her of failing to accept that her policies received considerably less support than those of her rival.”\n“Despite this, a few accepted that there could be merit in such a restructure. However, organising public voting across all Alliance systems would be much harder than in democracies with a more established infrastructure, such as the Federation, or that have smaller populations, such as the Marlinist Colonies.”","extractionDate":"2021-07-12T21:46:00Z","deprecated":false}
