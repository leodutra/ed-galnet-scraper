It has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, as part of an initiative to rid the system of corruption and crime.\nA spokesperson for NULL released the following statement:\n“Having secured the necessary funds, we are now in a position to offer generous rewards to pilots who support this two-pronged initiative. With the help of the galaxy’s independent pilots, we hope to both expand the economic power of LTT 4961 and bring peace to the system.”\nThe operation begins on the 13th of July 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
