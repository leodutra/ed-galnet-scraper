I attended a lavish event hosted by Jokers’ Deck, staked the entire Ambrose estate and lost it all. But I don’t regret a thing.”\n“The gambling problem I’ve suffered with for years has finally been cured. I believe my addiction was fuelled by having far more wealth than any individual should. I now plan to use my connections to raise funds for addiction support charities.”\n“I don’t blame Jokers’ Deck for my situation, since I knew the risks when I joined. And frankly, it could have been worse – I’ve seen corporations won and lost over a hand of deadlock poker.”"}
