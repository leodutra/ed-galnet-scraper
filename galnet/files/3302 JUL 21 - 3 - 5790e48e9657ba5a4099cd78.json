The appeal was part of an Imperial campaign to locate further barnacles, the only known source of meta-alloys.\nIn a brief statement, the spokesperson thanked the many Commanders who supported the campaign:\n\"We are immensely grateful to all the intrepid explorers who contributed to this initiative. Your data will now be analysed to see if it can reveal the location of further barnacle sites. Of course, this process is not an exact science, so it may take some time. We will keep the galactic community abreast of our progress.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:06:19Z","deprecated":false}
