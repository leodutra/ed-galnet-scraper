He told them:\n“I’m sick of churning out historical-romance garbage, especially now that readers can change the damn story to suit themselves! I’m going to write the book I’ve always wanted to write – a science-fiction saga set in the future.”\nA statement was released by Bonespire Publishing:\n“Unfortunately this incident constitutes a breach of contract, as Mr Redcourt has only produced fourteen Corsair King novels, rather than the twenty-five we agreed. We hope we can convince him to resume the tour and continue with the series.”\nMargaux Hist, the author’s agent, commented:\n“Olav’s a true artist, so I’m sure fans will understand that he wants a little creative freedom. I can’t tell you anything about the new title yet, but science-fiction is a niche genre with a tiny audience, so I hope it sells well enough to pay Olav’s legal bills.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:35:53Z","deprecated":false}
