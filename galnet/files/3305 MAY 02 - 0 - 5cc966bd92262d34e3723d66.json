Over three months later, after travelling more than 73,000 light years, ships have begun arriving at Beagle Point.”\n“Included among the expedition’s achievements is the construction of the scientific research station Explorer’s Anchorage. This now serves as a permanent waypoint for travellers to the galactic core, as well as facilitating detailed observation of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*.”\n“While Distant Worlds II is coming to a close, its participants will now plot their own routes through unexplored space back towards the core systems.”"}
