But look at what’s happening in Andavandul right now! There’s so much support from the galactic community. People are placing their faith in a better future than just endless warfare.”\n“My only regret is that I won’t be joining my fellow campaigners aboard the Kingfisher after all. The duties of my new congressional position mean that my diary has become full extremely quickly, with many commitments to uphold. But I’ll be travelling with them in spirit as they journey out to meet Taranis, and prove to its Thargoid controllers that humanity is ready to co-exist peacefully.”\nJoy Senne revealed that she had planned to ICE-cast a live show from the Kingfisher megaship, as it encountered the interstellar anomaly known as Taranis in the Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 system:\n“I was so disappointed when they told me that only direct transmissions aimed at Taranis would be permitted, to avoid confusing the ‘stargoid’ with other signals. Our good friend Heimar Borichev was due to join the crew today, but he messaged me less than an hour ago saying he’d fallen ill unexpectedly. So it’s left to the brave volunteers – we’re counting on you, Kingfisher!”\nThe Sovereign newsfeed confirmed these plans for its deputy editor, adding that opinion polls in independent systems suggested a 32% approval rate for the Thargoid Advocacy Project. Allied and Federal media primarily view the xeno-peace movement as ‘misguided’, while in the Empire the most common keyword associated with them is ‘suicidal’.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:13:28Z","deprecated":false}
