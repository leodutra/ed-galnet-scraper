This has proved invaluable in our ongoing fight against the Thargoids.”\n“It appears, however, that the sites are currently dormant, as no energy-level fluctuations have been detected for several days. Hopefully this means we can look forward to a temporary reprieve from Thargoid attacks.”\n“Our military flagships, the Vanguard and the Acropolis, will remain on standby in HIP 21559 and Irandan until needed.”"}
