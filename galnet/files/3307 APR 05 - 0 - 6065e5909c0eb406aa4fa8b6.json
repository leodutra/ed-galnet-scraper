Her official title is now Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval.\nPrincess Aisling Duval personally attended her cousin’s wedding at a secure location. She referred to it as “a precious moment of joy in these bleak times”.\nThe Imperial Palace and the Senate have sent congratulatory messages, and the event was covered by mainstream media.\nParesa News Network: “Astrid’s well-deserved rise to nobility has made her fellow Paresans very proud. Everyone at PNN is overjoyed for the happy couple!”\nEye on Achenar: “It’s an insult to the noble Duval bloodline when some trigger-jockey from a gutter system can sink her claws into the Emperor’s own nephew.”\nThe Imperial Herald: “Hadrian taking a bride at the age of 20 has surprised many. If he becomes the only Duval to produce heirs, it will place pressure on Emperor Arissa and Princess Aisling, neither of whom have consorts.”\nIn related news, Nova Imperium vessels are participating in the current conflict against the Neo-Marlinists of Mudhrid. Praetor Leo Magnus, head of security, is liaising with the IISS on anti-terrorism intelligence.","extraction_date":"2021-04-18T19:32:21Z","deprecated":false}
