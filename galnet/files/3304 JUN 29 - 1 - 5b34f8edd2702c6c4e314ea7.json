If Colonia’s population continues to increase at the current rate it could lead to a serious depletion of resources at some point in the future.”\n“Monitoring infrastructure, terraforming, logistics and other issues will require the construction of a dedicated centre for resource management. This will allow us to study the aggregated data and formulate a structured solution to avoid potential problems.”\nThe campaign is being run by Tir Technology Services, one of Colonia’s partner organisations, which has asked pilots to deliver commodities to Bolden’s Enterprise in the Tir system.\nThe campaign begins on the 28th of June 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:34:14Z","deprecated":false}
