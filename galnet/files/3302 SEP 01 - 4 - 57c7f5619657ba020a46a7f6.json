Other systems may be added to the list as the programme progresses.\nThe Alliance, the Empire and the Federation have all agreed to grant the Council exclusive access to these systems for the duration of its research programme. Civilian and military traffic will be free to traverse the region, but pilots pledged to one of the galaxy's major powers will be unable to lay claim to these systems while the project is active.\nProfessor Ray Miller, director of the organisation, elaborated on the nature of the exercise: \n\"The programme is in most respects unremarkable – we will be monitoring radiation levels, recording the positions of celestial bodies, and so on – but it is also highly sensitive. The passage of a single ship will not disturb our experiments, but large-scale activity could prove highly disruptive.\"\n\"We thank the galactic community in advance for its understanding.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:57:46Z","deprecated":false}
