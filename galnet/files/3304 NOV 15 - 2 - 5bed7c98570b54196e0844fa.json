The accumulated data was relayed to the Cordova Group, which published it in The Mars Tribune.”\nA spokesperson for the Achilles Corporation said:\n“The engineer has provided us with a ‘kill switch’ that remotely deletes the spy program she designed. This coreware update has now been transmitted to all PA912 model robots. We can therefore assure our customers that there is no longer any risk of their private information being misused.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:49:40Z","deprecated":false}
