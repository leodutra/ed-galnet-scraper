This was followed by a similar statement from Isolde Rochester, who will serve as Winters’s vice president.\nSofia Trevino, political journalist for The Federal Times, reported:\n“With these appointments, Felicia Winters is laying the foundations on which to build a new Federal government. Long-serving figures in the Liberal Party are finally being rewarded with key positions in the upcoming administration.”\n“One notable loyalist is Congressman Bai Zheng, who will be Secretary for Security. She is already well-known for opposing the Proactive Detection Bureau, and will undoubtedly take pleasure in overseeing the surveillance unit’s closure, as per Winters’s campaign promise.”\n“Congressman Kristine Lasky is another familiar name. Her celebrated role in creating the Cornelius-Lasky Convention, which enables superpowers to collaborate during emergencies, makes her a solid choice for Secretary of State.”\n“There are a few fresher faces among the forthcoming Cabinet. The new Grand Attorney will be Pierre-Marc Pelletier, a former director of the Federal Attorney’s Office. And the Secretary for Defence will be Congressman Conn Montgomery, who will have to navigate demands from a Federal Navy accustomed to Zachary Hudson’s generous military budgets.”\nIn related news, planning is underway for Felicia Winters’s inauguration ceremony to take place in mid-February. President Hudson’s office has confirmed that handover procedures are well advanced, with all government agencies and departments preparing for the Federation’s new leadership.","extractionDate":"2024-02-08T21:50:44Z","deprecated":false}
