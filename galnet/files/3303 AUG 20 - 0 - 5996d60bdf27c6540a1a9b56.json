Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.\nHere are the latest factions in withdrawal:\nOrder of Ethgreze\nCrimson State Group\nHIP 9610 Jet Legal Systems\nGitxsan Limited\nKuwemargl Patrons of Law\nBrotherhood of Caerete\nBegovans Industry \nCoalition of Bodedi\nHIP 113454 Crew\nGyvata Indi Purple Syndicate\nFactions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system."}
