The Progressive Party has increased its controlling influence of the system over the past week by over 10% with the aid of mercenary pilots. A spokesman said -\n“We have stepped up trading at Sellings City dock, and have increased our patrols of all seven Resource Extraction Sites in the system. We have met with significant push-back from local pirate factions. Fighting is intense, but profitable to successful pilots.”\n“We are hiring miners, traders, and bounty hunters to help us continue our takeover of the system.”\nOpposing factions could not be reached directly for comment. Stay tuned for updates.\nCMDR Otalp"}
