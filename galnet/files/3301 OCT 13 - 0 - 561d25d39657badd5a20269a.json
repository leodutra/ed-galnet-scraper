It handles beautifully and has looks to match. I was able to stick on the tail of an Imperial Courier during combat exercises. It's a great addition to the Gutamaya portfolio.\" Commander Stateira 'Starcloak' Eleshenar added: \"I love my Eagle, so I was curious to see if Gutamaya could improve on Core Dynamics' classic design. Now I've taken it out a few times, I'm happy to say it retains all the sublime responsiveness of the Eagle, and packs a harder punch in combat.\"\nWhen asked about the secret of Gutamaya Shipyards' success, lead engineer Ines Allende responded: \"Elegance in simplicity. We kept the core design that made the Eagle Mk II great and simply tinkered with a few key elements.\"\nCommander Stateira \"Starcloak\" Eleshenar\nJameson Memorial Review | Interstellar Press","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:26:48Z","deprecated":false}
