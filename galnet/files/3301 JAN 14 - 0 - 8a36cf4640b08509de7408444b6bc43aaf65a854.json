In a statement Senator Torval declared -\n“Once again the machinations of Federal agitators have been defeated. They will never learn. They deceived some of our loyal citizens into supporting their actions, but now they have publicly admitted their fault, in this instance we will be magnanimous.”\nShe also praised the actions of the many independent pilots who once again supported her campaign.\nCommentators have expressed their support for the Senator’s merciful action.
