Margrave Corentin Delacroix, the faction’s new military ruler and the son of former Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, announced:\n“The Steel Majesty has returned home to fulfil its destiny. Be warned: should any ships attempt to board or attack, all the former crewmembers still onboard will be executed.”\nSenior Agent Tanya Ramirez gave a statement on behalf of ACT:\n“Unfortunately, we cannot take action while hundreds of innocent people remain captive. But the NMLA’s effort to assemble troops, supporters and resources must not succeed. Having the Steel Majesty as a mobile base will allow them to regroup for a new campaign of terror – especially if they manage to reach Theta Seven before we do.”\nA spokesperson for the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group, which controls the Mudhrid system, claimed:\n“The hostages should be considered lost as casualties of war. We are prepared to perform our duty for the Empire once again by destroying the Neo-Marlinist threat.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:14:49Z","deprecated":false}
