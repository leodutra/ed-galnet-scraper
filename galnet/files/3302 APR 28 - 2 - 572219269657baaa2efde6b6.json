According to a member of her personal staff, the former leader believes the data will prove there are super-intelligent beings living in the depths of space.\nThe former Federal president released a brief statement to the media:\n\"They are out there. I have seen them. We must put aside our petty differences and work together to establish contact. There is so much we could learn from them.\"\nThe Azaleach Partnership has agreed to coordinate the campaign on Halsey's behalf, and to reward pilots who deliver exploration data to Leoniceno Orbital. The appeal begins on the 28th of April 3302 and will run for one week."}
