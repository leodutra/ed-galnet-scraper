Fearing that her career was fading, she arranged her ‘mysterious’ disappearance to enhance her fame, paying her crew enormous sums to follow suit.”\n“Ms Knight has now fled Rhea and is presumably living in seclusion elsewhere.”\nMany of Knight’s fans have disputed this account, claiming that such elaborate deception is out of character for the actor. Authorities have accepted the explanation, however, and the investigation has been officially closed.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:27:30Z","deprecated":false}
