Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 524 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nUnited Epsilon Indi Flag\nErh Lohra Crew\nBD-02 4304 Jet Drug Empire\nRoss 720 Crimson Cartel\nGridge Public Group\nJupalo Purple Boys\nPeople's Urvane Labour\nMahei Posse\nHR 8170 Blue General Commodities\nLiberals of Wolf 287\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing."}
