I don’t mind sharing that Ram Tah is delighted, and is currently refining his theory with the aid of specialists from all three superpowers.”\n“We hope to reveal more details very soon, but at this point it’s worth managing expectations around the proposed anti-Titan weapon. It remains true that our existing armaments are incapable of inflicting damage on Thargoid motherships. But if Ram Tah is correct, we may be able to reveal certain vulnerabilities by exploiting a newly discovered aspect of Guardian technology.”\nA spokesperson from Aegis also revealed that Professor Palin is supporting Ram Tah’s research, stating: “The most prominent engineers of our age are once again working together to defend humanity against the Thargoid threat.”\nAegis has confirmed that all participants in the delivery campaign can now collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.","extractionDate":"2024-02-08T21:50:20Z","deprecated":false}
