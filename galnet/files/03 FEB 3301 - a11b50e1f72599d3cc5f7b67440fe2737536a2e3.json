The event, which will now be held on the first Sunday of every month, sees pilots flying their basic, weapons and shield-free Sidewinders at full speed around the airlock ring in an attempt to blow each other up. \nSlough Orbitalâ€™s Captain, Commander Rose, has expressed frustration at these troubling turn of events. Telling GalNet -\n\"The Jet Transport Corporation lost a lot of trade last Sunday. No ships were able to enter or leave the station for almost an hour for fear of being blasted into smithereens by these lunatic pilots.\"\nCommander Angel Rose, daughter of Captain Rose, has praised the event, saying -\n\"My father is a stuffy old codger. Everyone had a lot of fun, especially this month's derby winner, Commander Scicobalt. No-one was actually hurt, although Commander Belstarion's pride took a big dent when he got repeatedly stuck in the stations superstructure. I look forward to doing it all again next month!\""}
