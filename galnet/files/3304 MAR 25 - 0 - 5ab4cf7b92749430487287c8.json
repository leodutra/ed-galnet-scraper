The Federation remains dedicated to wiping out any threat to our citizens.”\nImperial Admiral Denton Patreus adopted a similar viewpoint: \n“This new information makes it clear that the Thargoids will reject any diplomatic overtures. We must redouble our efforts to defend ourselves from their antagonism.”\nMeanwhile, Professor Palin observed: \n“Aegis’s report forewarns us, and perhaps forearms us, too. We now know that the Guardians developed technologies capable of resisting the Thargoids’ aggression. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to hope that the weaponry being developed by Ram Tah, based on Guardian designs, might help us replicate the Guardians’ success, and defeat the Thargoids.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:34:24Z","deprecated":false}
