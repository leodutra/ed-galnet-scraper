Although their intentions remain unclear, I can confirm they were acting purely in their own interests, and without official knowledge.”\n“The rogue officers, including those extradited into our custody by the Meene Defence Force, now face multiple charges, and could be imprisoned for life.”\n“I would like to express my sincere regret over this incident, and to personally apologise to Ram Tah. I continue to hope that we can work together on further Guardian-human technology.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:29:46Z","deprecated":false}
