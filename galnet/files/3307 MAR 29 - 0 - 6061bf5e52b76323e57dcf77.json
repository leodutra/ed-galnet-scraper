Senator Lorcan Scordato has volunteered to visit the Marlinist Colonies on a fact-finding mission, to better understand the political character of the Neo-Marlinist fringe.” \nEye on Achenar: “The entire system is still shellshocked by the slaughter at Dawes Hub, a vicious stab at the heart of our glorious Empire. In our opinion poll, 93% of right-thinking citizens would send a fleet of Majestics to the murdering Marlinists instead of some soft-hearted senator.”\nVox Galactica: “In most Imperial cities and settlements, anxiety levels remain high. The NMLA’s ability to strike seemingly anywhere has rocked public confidence in the Empire’s strength. Opinions on Marlinism itself are more polarised than ever, with accusations of ‘warmonger’ and ‘collaborator’ dividing many families and relationships.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-30T23:33:21Z","deprecated":false}
