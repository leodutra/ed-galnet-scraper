But never mind that! What we want to know is: who is the galaxy’s most eligible princess dating?”\n“Let’s face it, there must be no end of gentlemen focusing their sights on her. She’s a Duval, the daughter of the late Emperor, and a woman of enormous charm, intelligence and culture. Plus – she’s a stunner!”\n“Three years ago it looked like Admiral Denton Patreus might be the one tying the knot. But we can assume that Aisling Duval spurned his advances, perhaps concluding – like many of us – that Patreus was more interested in the Imperial throne than anything else. So, who might be wooing the ‘people’s princess’ now?”\n“The first possibility is Senator Caspian Leopold, who has attended many meetings with Aisling and speaks warmly of her in interviews. Of course, the senator is almost twice her age, but he is undoubtedly a gifted orator, not to mention enormously wealthy and influential. And sometimes experience wins out!”\n“On the other end of the scale is a young man called Jarl Toredo, who has been spotted visiting Aisling at the palace. This passionate firebrand runs an organisation called Universal Liberty, and has made a name for himself campaigning against Imperial slavery. So naturally, any relationship would give Aisling’s own charity an enormous PR boost.”\n“Toredo is a salt-of-the-earth type who has worked hard to build a life for himself. His background could not be more different from Aisling’s, with both his parents having died in servitude. A romance seems unlikely…but I wouldn’t rule it out!”\n“Potential suitor number three, Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester, has been stationed on Aisling’s home planet Emerald, where the two of them took a private tour around the Prism’s Shades art installation. The tall and handsome ambassador cut a striking figure beside the princess, as the empathic art pulsed with light around them. A political gesture designed to soothe relations with the Federation, or something more personal?”\n“One thing’s for sure – Princess Duval walks her own path, and has no problem with upsetting the established order. So when it comes to her love life, all bets are off!”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:15:39Z","deprecated":false}
