Zende Partners will manage both outposts in the system, and the megaship transport service will continue operating on a weekly basis from Zende.”\n“I am also proud to announce that we have begun manufacture of our new Advanced Multi-cannon at The Prospect, using recently acquired Guardian materials.”\nIn a subdued response, Cedrik Stone stated the following: \n“Segnen Exchange has decided to withdraw from Synuefe EN-H d11-96 and focus our resources on previously established operations. While this setback has interfered with our research and development schedule, we will learn from this experience and continue to grow as a company.”\nPilots who participated in the conflict can now collect rewards from the Synuefe EN-H d11-96 system. Supporters of Zende Partners must journey to The Prospect, while supporters of Segnen Exchange should visit Indigo Dock.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:35:45Z","deprecated":false}
