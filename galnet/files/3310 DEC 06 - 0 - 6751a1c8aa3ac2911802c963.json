But distress calls were sounded within minutes of arrival with the few recovered survivors claiming the Thargoids had arrived in alarming numbers at the precise arrival location.\nThe following rescue megaships have been lost:\n- Federal Haven in Sol\n- Rescue Ship Bertschinger in Sol\n- Rescue Ship Foerster in Sol\n- Rescue Ship Kisseih in Wolf 359\n- Rescue Ship Cavell in Alpha Centauri\n- Rescue Ship Yoshida in Barnard's Star\n- Rescue Ship Seacole in Wise 1506+7027\nTwo rescue megaships have so far not been attacked and are orchestrating evacuation efforts for Sol and surrounding systems:\n- Rescue Ship Hutner in Luyten’s Star\n- Rescue Ship Cornwallis in V886 Centauri\nThe Allied Solace and Imperial Sanctum rescue megaships were not deployed towards Sol and remain in their respective locations of Sun Wen and Hixkaramu. Given this alarming news, it seems unlikely they will be sent into the dangerous area around Sol now.","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:35Z","deprecated":false}
