The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nLords of Ngaliba\nChamunda Crimson Gang\ni Bootis Central Limited\nLHS 535 Silver United Ltd\nHIP 6758 Posse\nLTT 2622 Crimson Power Solutions\nOrishpucho Jet Hand Gang\nNagii Union\nHIP 5700 Electronics Co\nRobigo Cartel\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished.
