As a result, a new asteroid base named The Print Works has been established in the Millese system.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, the organisation’s spokesperson issued the following statement: \n\"Thanks to all you delightful pilots, we now have a lovely new print works in Millese to produce the galaxy's finest magazine. We’re absolutely thrilled, and everyone who helped is welcome to visit us in our new home.\"\nContributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from McMullen Ring in the Millese system."}
