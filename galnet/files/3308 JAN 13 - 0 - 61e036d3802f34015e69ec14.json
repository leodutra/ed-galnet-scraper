But with the contract up for renewal, Torval Mining Ltd is making a bid for the lucrative business.\nConstantia Torval, operations director for the Empire-based company, outlined the initiative:\n“We are calling upon pilots to provide the following mined materials: bromellite, samarium and gallite. These should be delivered to the Pride of Bitterwood in the Dulos system. Your assistance will directly support our proposal to win this contract and expand our entire enterprise.”\nCaine-Massey published a similar request from its vice president, Johann Fleischer:\n“The citizens within this region deserve a high standard of service, and we aim to continue meeting their needs. The Green Party of Dulos, acting on our behalf, shall offer generous rewards for shipments of mined bromellite, samarium and gallite delivered to Smith Port in the Dulos system.”\nThe corporate distributors within the region have agreed that whichever candidate is able to provide the greatest amount of materials will be awarded the contract for the next decade.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:14:17Z","deprecated":false}
