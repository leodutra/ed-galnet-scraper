But she gracefully acknowledged that the Marlinist population had declined her invitation to become an Imperial protectorate, and would thus remain independent.”\n“However, there was a proviso to Emperor Arissa’s acceptance of the decision. She insisted that the Marlinist Colonies must work with the Empire’s intelligence agencies to prevent any resurgence of the NMLA or similar terrorist groups.”\nIt has since been agreed that Imperial Intelligence and the Marlinist Constabulary would collaborate on identifying Neo-Marlinist extremists. Colonel Saskia Landau and Major Milo Castile, both former co-leaders of ACT, have agreed to work together once again.\nIn recognition of the minority who voted to rejoin the Empire, dedicated customs and immigration channels for registered Marlinist citizens will soon be established.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:28:35Z","deprecated":false}
