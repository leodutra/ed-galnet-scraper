When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nCoalition of Ngaliba \nPotriti Gold Mafia \nAutocracy of Phi Gruis \nNang Ta-khian Public Co \nHuaich Independents \nEshu Gold Mafia \nRuchbah Progressive Party \nTraditional Kakmbutan Justice Party \nG 239-25 Alliance\nLFT 880 Vision Company\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:09:16Z","deprecated":false}
