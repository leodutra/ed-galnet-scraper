It does not guarantee that I – or any future president – can remain in office indefinitely.”\n“Furthermore, the Republican Party will be able to field other electoral nominees, as will the Liberal Party and any independent candidates. As always, the votes of the people will determine who forms our government.”\n“I strongly believe that our constitution is robust enough to accommodate changes such as this, especially during these trying times. The Federation remains a place of democracy and freedom, not dictatorship.”\nPresident Hudson also called for an end to the recent violence seen at public demonstrations on many Federal worlds. Several cities have witnessed aggressive clashes between Hudson’s supporters and those of Shadow President Felicia Winters.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:15:27Z","deprecated":false}
