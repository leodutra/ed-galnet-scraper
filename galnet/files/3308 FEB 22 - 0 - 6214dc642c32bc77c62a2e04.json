She has rightfully objected to the sitting president’s attempt at throwing away the rulebook. Repealing the 77th amendment would be a fundamental blow to our millennia-old democracy.”\nSol Today: “What’s the choice here? Retain Hudson for a few more years until things calm down, or hand power to Winters and watch the Federal government weaken and collapse under a weight the shadow president cannot possibly bear?”\nThe Federal Times: “Moderate Republican voters are taking a dim view of the Hudson Contravention, primarily because it denies them the option to choose a new administration. Vice President Jerome Archer, Secretary of State Lana Berkovich and Grand Attorney Edwin Espinosa are the most likely presidential candidates, but none of them will be able to run for office in 3309 if Hudson gets his way.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:23:58Z","deprecated":false}
