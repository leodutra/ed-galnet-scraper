Our targets are Cassiopeia A and Tycho's Star.\"\n\"This is not space tourism. The expedition to Cassiopeia A will take us into an area of space referred to as the Formidine Rift, which before the advent of the frame shift drive had a reputation as a kind of Bermuda Triangle. Few who venture into the Rift return to tell the tale.\"\nThe expedition is expected to depart from Chi Orionis in the first week of November 3302.\nJaiotu","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:00:26Z","deprecated":false}
