The new abrasion blaster fires projectiles that break them free more easily.”\n“For deeper deposits, sub-surface displacement missiles can penetrate the rock and then be detonated remotely, releasing larger chunks of material.”\n“Finally, there is now a way to access valuable resources deep within certain rare bodies. Seismic charges, when carefully positioned, can crack an asteroid open and free the minerals at its core.”\n“Combined with upgrades to existing tools, such as scanners and prospector limpets, we are confident that these new tools will result in a surge in private mining activity.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:16:38Z","deprecated":false}
