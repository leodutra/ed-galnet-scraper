But for each new device we develop, we need huge quantities of Thargoid material so we can calibrate the technology and ensure its efficacy.\"\nThe initiative has received financial support from the Wyrd Jet Power Industries, which has pledged to reimburse pilots who deliver Thargoid Cyclops tissue samples, micro controllers and explosives to Vonarburg Co-operative in the Wyrd system.\nThe campaign begins on the 5th of October and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:44:41Z","deprecated":false}
