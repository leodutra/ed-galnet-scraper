Bioluminescent nodules no longer pulse their sickly glow. Spires blot out the stars above, twisted towers made from solid night. Mega barnacles have ceased producing their foul byproducts. I’m walking through an alien cemetery.”\n“The soldiers escorting me constantly perform pirouettes with their weapons, trigger-twitchy. But there are no black-hulled monstrosities spitting fire from the shadows or wheeling across the sky. Only rotted mineral sacs drooping from mechanical vines, and decaying chunks of necrotised metal. Even the nerve points that once triggered glandular responses have grown dull.”\nProfessor Shamus Madigan, Federal scientific liaison to Aegis, discussed these developments via Vox Galactica:\n“Multiple pilots introduced Professor Palin’s contaminant into the supply lines for these spires, but it’s still remarkable how quickly it took effect. With large quantities of the contaminant in place, the Thargoids seem to have abandoned the site in Hyades Sector ST-Q B5-5. Perhaps maintenance drones were unable to keep the site viable for its purpose. Efforts are underway to repeat this success at other sites.”\n“What this means for the Thargoid invasion fleets remains unclear as yet. If we are right and the Titans depend upon these biomechanical foundries, the loss of these sites may prove invaluable. But so far – though Taranis has lost control of surrounding systems – there is no evidence that the motherships have been affected by the spire sites’ inactivity.”","extractionDate":"2024-02-08T21:50:02Z","deprecated":false}
