Rescue operations have saved over a million people, but local infrastructure has been compromised and vital construction supplies are running low.\nPresident-Elect Felicia Winters spoke publicly for the first time since leaving for Rhea 3 to announce a support initiative:\n“I know that there are individuals out there who have tried to use my absence from office to undermine the will of the Federation’s people by calling for a re-election. Of course they have. To them I say simply this: to care for your home planet, for your people, is not a weakness.”\n“But unfortunately, I have now reached the limit of what I can do to help through private channels, so I am humbly requesting the aid of our galaxy’s pilots. Please, provide crucial materials to support Rhea 3’s recovery.”\nFederal Liberal Command, the controlling faction, has called for pilots to transport Power Generators, Aluminium, and Titanium to Ito Orbital in the Rhea system.\nIn related news, the formation of a new Federal government by the Liberal Party continues to be delayed with no confirmed inauguration in sight. Proposals for a re-election, or for President Hudson to remain in office for another term, have been rejected by Congress once again.","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:29Z","deprecated":false}
