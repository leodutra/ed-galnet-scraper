Our own observations at Bond Hub in Varati support this: the artefacts appear to affect stations in the same way they affect ships, with potentially disastrous consequences.\"\n\"Given these findings, we are deeply troubled by the surge in value of UAs across the black market, which clearly led to this increase in sales. Who caused this increase? Did they know the effect it would have?\"\nCommander Lord Zoltan","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:37:40Z","deprecated":false}
