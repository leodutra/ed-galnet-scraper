This is why we do not share our advancements with the galaxy.”\nIndependent healthcare analyst Dr Himari Grey commented:\n“Vitadyne sees the Interstellar Health Organisation's decision as a victory, but others in the medical community have expressed reservations. To deny Utopia’s ownership of these nanomedicines means permanently closing the door on any future cooperation with the community. What other potential benefits have been lost?”\nVitadyne Labs has invited pharmaceutical giants Neomedical Industries and Vandermeer Corporation to bid for a licence to distribute Vitadyne nanomeds in their territories.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:57:48Z","deprecated":false}
