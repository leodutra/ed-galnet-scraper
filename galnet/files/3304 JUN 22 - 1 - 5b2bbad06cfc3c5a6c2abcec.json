The construction of a military installation will allow us to continue our fight against the Thargoids unhindered by external forces.”\nAegis Research has placed an open order for mined resources, promising to reward pilots who deliver these to The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure those contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely.\nThe campaign begins on the 21st of June 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:08:30Z","deprecated":false}
