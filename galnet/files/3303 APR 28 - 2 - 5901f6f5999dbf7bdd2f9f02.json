Reports indicate that the agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.\nTo counter this threat, the Cartoq Purple Major Organisation has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the Cartoq system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Avdeyev Settlement.\nThe campaign begins on 27th of April 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:48:04Z","deprecated":false}
