Pilots who deliver these intoxicants to Zander Dock in HIP 110028 system will be handsomely rewarded.\nA spokesperson for the group said:\n\"This is a great opportunity to bring new business to one of the galaxy's border colonies. We are asking independent pilots for help, and we are prepared to offer very competitive prices for the liquors we have requested.\"\nThe campaign begins on the 28th of September 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:42:33Z","deprecated":false}
