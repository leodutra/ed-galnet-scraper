Hundreds of pilots supported the campaign by delivering construction materials to Dirichlet Orbital, the campaign's centre.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Jasmina Halsey released a statement:\n\"It is clear to me that, in the current political climate, peace cannot be achieved without practical effort. It feels so good to do something that will have a measurable impact.\"\n\"My sincere thanks go to the many pilots who supported this campaign, and to the Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry for its generous financial support.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dirichlet Orbital in the Yum Kamcabi system."}
