Over 300 pilots from across inhabited space have signed up to take part in the largest convoy ever assembled, designated the August Exodus â€“ A Jaunt to Jaques.\nThe first convoy, comprising 250 pilots, set off from the Ocshooit system on the 24th of July, and is expected to reach Jaques Station within two weeks. The second convoy is being assembled, and almost 60 pilots have signed up so far. It will depart on the 15th of August.\nIt is hoped that this monumental effort will not only return Jaques Station to full operational power, but also usher in the birth of a new colony in the Colonia Nebula, where Jaques is currently located.\nCommander unrealization\nZandu Science Journal | Interstellar Press","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:46:08Z","deprecated":false}
