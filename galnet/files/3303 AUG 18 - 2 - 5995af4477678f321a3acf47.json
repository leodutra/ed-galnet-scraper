Figures from the worlds of finance, politics and entertainment are expected to attend the event, which this year will be held in the Secoya system.\nThe Summit is not without its detractors, with political commentator Sal Riley recently condemning it as \"a grotesquely opulent and outmoded display of self-congratulation\". Nevertheless, the number of influential figures in attendance has prompted suggestions that more policy making is concluded at the Summit than in the Senate.\nAs the event approaches, Secoya Emperor's Grace has placed an open order for a range of luxury commodities, promising to reward pilots who delivering master chefs, Kamitra cigars and Sanuma decorative meat to Joy Port in the Secoya system.\nThe campaign begins on the 17th of August 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:20:31Z","deprecated":false}
