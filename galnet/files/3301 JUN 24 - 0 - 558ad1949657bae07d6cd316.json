Despite this, the Federation has yet to take an official stance on the Pirate King’s activities.\nGalNet reached out to the Federal Navy for comment and was informed that:\n“The Navy is aware of the situation in the Pegasi sector. The issue will be resolved in due course, but we are unable to divulge any operational details at this time.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:14:47Z","deprecated":false}
