We continue to see a yearly growth rate of between 1 and 2% per sector, which in many cases means that we are exceeding our targets.”\n“The losses posted for this year are partly due to the construction of a completely new and extremely exciting line of VR-Streams, which includes the latest instalment in the popular CQC franchise.”\n“In-sim purchases within Federal markets have fallen below expected levels, but an analysis of the market suggests that such losses are part of a general downward trend that appears to be affecting a wide range of media companies operating in Federal systems. The cause of this drop-off in purchases remains unclear at this time.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:00:44Z","deprecated":false}
