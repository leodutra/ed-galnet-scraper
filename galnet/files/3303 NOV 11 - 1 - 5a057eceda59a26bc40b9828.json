The Conservatives of Tiliala have retained the right to issue permits, but they now have only a marginal presence in Tiliala, having relocated to a Wells-class Carrier in nearby Akandinigua.”\nThe Conservatives have secured the support of various corporate and political partners to ensure their new asset does not fall into enemy hands. One of these partners, who elected to remain anonymous, said:\n“We do not want to see our friends suffer any further losses. We have therefore taken steps to ensure their new home, Tiliala’s Lament, cannot be taken from them.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:16:25Z","deprecated":false}
