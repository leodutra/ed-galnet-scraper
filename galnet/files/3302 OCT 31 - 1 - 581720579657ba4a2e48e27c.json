When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nE.X.O\nProgressive Party of Bolg\nIndependent Guan Zaihe League\nCo-op of Mbokokumal\nIntegrated Shu Babassi\nRevolutionary 5 G. Apodis Values Party\nHojin Blue Dragons\nDukes of LTT 2893\nSorbacoc Society\nNamniez Free\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished.
