The few surviving ships in the Trask Death Corsairs have now abandoned his cause.\nReports from The Pegasi Sentinel and Vox Galactica newsfeeds have shed more light on the insurrection. Over the past few years, Trask secretly gathered followers while acting as Archon Delaine’s trusted advisor. Funded by successful gambling at Jokers’ Deck events, he bought the loyalty of many independent criminal groups to bolster his forces.\nIt has also been revealed that Trask’s previously unidentified mercenaries were members of the Blue Viper Club dredger clan. This suggests that his partner in the coup attempt was indeed Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, who originally hailed from the nomadic tribe. She was last seen returning to the dredger before it jumped to an unknown destination.\nArchon Delaine, who is still recovering from last week’s assassination attempt, proclaimed:\n“I will hunt down and slaughter every single one of Volantyne’s treacherous clan for their betrayal of my trust. That rusting hulk will find no refuge in this galaxy!”\nPilots who supported the Kumo Council faction can now collect rewards from Crimson Exchange in HIP 10792.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:14:55Z","deprecated":false}
