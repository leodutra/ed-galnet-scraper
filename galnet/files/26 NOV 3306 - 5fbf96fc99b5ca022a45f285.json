These are:\nBetancourt Base in the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system.\nCole Point in the Coalsack Sector VU-0 B6-6 system.\nHannu Arena in the Musca Dark Region IM-V C2-24 system.\nBering Port in the Coalsack Sector KN-S B4-9 system.\nThe starports will serve as launchpads for further exploration of the region. Several corporations are working in partnership with the Alliance to locate commercial and scientific sites of interest.\nOne of the new research stations, Betancourt Base, has requested deliveries of Thargoid commodities. Chief xenobiologist Dr Rodion Stathos outlined the offer:\n“The Thargoids have been in the Coalsack Nebula for at least two hundred years, giving us an opportunity to increase our understanding of this alien species. Thanks to funding provided by pharmaceutical and bioengineering companies, we can offer generous rewards for shipments of Thargoid biological matter and other artefacts.”"}
