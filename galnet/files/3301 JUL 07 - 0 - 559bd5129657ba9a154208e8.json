They recognise each otherâ€™s right to exist, and to co-exist in harmony and in peace. Their ships are free to travel within each other's space.\nAll freelance Commanders wishing to sign the pact are welcomed in Lembava or Polevnic to do so and make sure that part of the galaxy will be more secure in the future.\nThis agreement has been made to seek the benefit of both their independent territories as a whole, to promote trade between the two powers and ensure the continued existence of civilization devoted to future prosperity rather than past tradition or present comfort.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:08:11Z","deprecated":false}
