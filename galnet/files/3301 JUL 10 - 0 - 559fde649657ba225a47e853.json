All of which is considered more concerning now that it is understood that the artefacts appear to have knowledge of morse code, and thus potentially other human technologies, embedded within them.\nDr Arcanonn's team have renewed their plea to the Federal Government to release any information they possess about the artefacts in order to assist with the continuing research."}
