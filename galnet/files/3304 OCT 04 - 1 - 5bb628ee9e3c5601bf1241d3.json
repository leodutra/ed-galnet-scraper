The organisation, which specialises in politics and current events, aims to reach a much wider audience with the construction of this mobile studio.\nAlessandra Koa of Broadcast Cobra issued the following statement:\n“As a broadcaster, we like the idea of a ship that can carry our signal to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. A megaship will allow us to transmit to systems that other broadcasters can only dream of reaching.”\nTo facilitate construction of the megaship, Broadcast Cobra has placed an open order for thorium, indium and superconductors, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Sopwith Dock in the HIP 16038 system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing material can do so safely.\nThe campaign begins on the 4th of October 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:58:32Z","deprecated":false}
