Vice Admiral Skylar Anderson, part of the Imperial delegation to Aegis, offered this comment:\n“Shortening the distance between systems which require humanitarian support and the megaships responsible for coordinating that support is important. Until now we have urged caution to maintain their current safe positions, since these vessels are obvious targets for Thargoid attack. But as our brave pilots continue to regain territory and push the alien forces back, we feel confident that this is the right decision.”\nFrom September 7th, the following megaships will temporarily cease offering new mission contracts.
