It was one of ten brand-new robots being loaded onto an orbital cargo shuttle.\nVideo feeds show the huge machine self-activating and breaking out of its container. It used its mining lasers, fusion drills and excavator claws to carve a path across the landing field. The robot then burrowed into the ground and disappeared.\nSecurity Chief Sara Kulkarni gave the following statement to the media:\n“Sensor drones are performing subterranean scans, but have not yet located the robot. We have therefore declared a regional state of emergency. Should the machine accidentally rupture a water main or pierce an underground power line, the potential for significant damage – even loss of life – is high.”\nDirector Chen Emerson of MacArthur Mining Ltd made this statement:\n“We are shocked by this incident, and an urgent inquiry is underway. The DG090 series is highly reliable and has never malfunctioned before. Our theory is that, due to human error, the unit was placed in the incorrect standby mode, and that stray signals from a nearby comms network triggered a preset program. We are supporting all efforts to locate the robot and shut it down.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:31:43Z","deprecated":false}
