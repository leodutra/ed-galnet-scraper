This has been tied to Princess Aisling Duval in particular, currently enjoying a good reputation among non-Imperial populations due to her work as a delegate to Aegis and a champion of humanitarian causes for those impacted by the xeno war.”\n“Shadow-President Jerome Archer has stamped down on this flourishing popularity and was described as ‘outraged’ by the notion of Imperial influence in the heart of the Federation. Republican media outlets, counteragents and even the Proactive Detection Bureau were deployed to quell the initial unrest.”\nPrincess Aisling has denied any involvement in the growth of Imperial support, but did imply that Federal populations ‘should not be spurned for the consideration of new ideas’.\nIt has been noted that a core of Aisling’s supporters remain active in Barnard’s Star, which no doubt concerns the Federal government.","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:54Z","deprecated":false}
