Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 576 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nLabour of Cernobog\nMalloc Law Party\nIntegrated Gundiae\nBrotherhood of Guathiti\t\nDrug Empire of Apam Napat\nEvejitaka Liberals\nUnited Xuanduna Resistance\nDragons of Nastrond\nLaedla Netcoms Systems\nIndependents of Udihikoja\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:37:15Z","deprecated":false}
