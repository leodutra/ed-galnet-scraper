The news has triggered efforts to swiftly establish a human presence in the area.\nAegis Research released this statement from Professor Alba Tesreau:\n\"Having analysed large amounts of exploration data, graciously provided by the galactic community, we can confirm that the Witch Head Nebula contains enough barnacle sites to meet the demand for meta-alloys. I am confident that these sites will offer a suitable alternative to the exhausted barnacles in the Pleiades Nebula.\"\nThe Alliance, Empire and Federation have already dispatched advance teams to the region. Each superpower has asked the galactic community to support its respective initiative and help them establish megaships and Ocellus starports in the nebula.\nWith the Pleiades sources of meta-alloys now almost completely depleted, independent traders will play a key role in ensuring that this vital commodity remains available to humanity.\nPilots seeking to participate in any of the three initiatives will be able to find further information on the nearest mission board.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:37:53Z","deprecated":false}
