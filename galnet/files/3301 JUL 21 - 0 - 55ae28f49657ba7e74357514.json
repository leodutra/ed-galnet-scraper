The Reboot/Repair sequence failed to fix the fuel scoop.\nSeveral commanders responded to the distress call, including Domaq, Paul_Kavinsky, Rusticolus, Cpt_Shinobi, Surly_badger, and Anuranium.\nCmdr. Domaq quickly arrived on scene and provided an initial refuelling to ensure the ship could remain powered while the other ships moved into position.\nA relay operation involving several ships and roughly 540 limpet drones then proceeded. Speed was a priority due to the damage Cmdr. Neospikeâ€™s ship had undergone leaving all of his systems at less than 5%.\nAs of this reporting the Fuel Rat initiative has rescued over 190 stranded pilots."}
