Admiral Natalia Lee, commanding the Harmony’s Shield megaship, announced:\n“Our purpose is to eliminate the terrorists who slaughtered so many Federal citizens. We advise the Empire to stand aside and allow us to deliver justice.”\nMagister Julius Halstrom of the Peraesii Empire Consulate declared:\n“In the name of the Emperor, we stand ready to purge the NMLA from the Paresa system – and the Federation too, unless they withdraw.”\nHadrian Duval has broadcast a message via Paresa News Network:\n“The NMLA faked my identity when dealing with the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, knowing the superpowers would do their work for them by killing another Duval. Nova Imperium will defend itself if necessary, but we are not responsible for any terrorist attacks.”\nACT is still attempting to corroborate evidence provided by the Landgrave of Mudhrid. Praetor Leo Magnus, Nova Imperium’s security chief, is reportedly aiding their enquiries.\nThe Senate has urgently requested direction from the Emperor, but Chancellor Blaine declared “Her Majesty cannot pass judgement upon a live investigation.”","extractionDate":"2021-07-12T21:45:51Z","deprecated":false}
