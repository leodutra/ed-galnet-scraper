In an effort to restore order, the Colonia Council has issued a call to aid, pledging to reward pilots who help reduce the criminals’ numbers. The Nameless has responded in kind, promising generous incentives to those who help fight the Colonia Council’s peacekeepers.\nBoth factions have set out week-long operations to achieve their aims, which will begin on the 19th of October 3303.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:57:59Z","deprecated":false}
