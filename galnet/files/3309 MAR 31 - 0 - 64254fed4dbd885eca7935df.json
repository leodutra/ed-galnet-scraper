He was targeted in the audience by long-range plasma fire that proved immediately fatal. Security forces were unable to locate the shooter, but the weapon and other items were recovered.\nPhilippa Barlow-Lyons , the COO of Caine-Massey, told the media:\n“I am saddened and sickened by this tragedy, as is everyone in the Caine-Massey family. Johann was approved as our new CEO late last year. He was a much-respected champion of enterprise, and a close personal friend. No effort must be spared in finding his murderer.”\nExecutive Agent Viola Trask provided a statement from the Federal Intelligence Agency:\n“At present, the assassin’s identity and whereabouts remain unknown. The weapon used in the attack was a professionally modified Manticore Executioner marksman rifle. Local police also found advanced ECM equipment that was used to disrupt security systems. These particular models are known to be utilised by undercover Imperial agents. However, a thorough investigation is underway and we have drawn no conclusions as yet.”","extractionDate":"2023-06-23T20:13:05Z","deprecated":false}
