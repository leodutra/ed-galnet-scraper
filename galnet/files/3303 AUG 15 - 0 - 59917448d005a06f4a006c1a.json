When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nLHS 3479 Interstellar\nMorgor Crimson Pirates\nBD-13 2439 Comms Systems\nLHS 2884 Dominion\nLambda Hydri Industry\nPeople's LFT 551 League\nLHS 3006 Blue Brotherhood\nPartnership of Alpha Centauri\nEarls of Dahan\nThe Order of Justice\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending."}
