When I went back to the landing pad I discovered the hangar was empty and my ship had gone missing!”\nThe starport issued a statement from Security Chief Misaki Sanders:\n“We are at a loss to explain how the thief managed to hijack our security network, gain entry to a docked and sealed ship, and override authorisation checks to fly out of the station unchallenged.”\n“Nearby systems have been alerted and we are collecting leads to track down the stolen vessel. In the meantime, we are conducting an inquiry into how these breaches of docking bay protocols could have occurred.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:17:39Z","deprecated":false}
