At this point we would also like to address rumours that the Far God sect is experimenting on willing test subjects in the hopes of ascending to a higher form of life. We assert, in the strongest of terms, that this is baseless gossip.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Wheelock Ring in the Zavijah system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:47:17Z","deprecated":false}
