Over half of her shares were then sold, thereby drastically reducing her personal influence on the corporation.\nAn anonymous insider gave a statement to The Imperial Herald:\n“Gabriella Mastopolos made it crystal clear to the other shareholders that it was time to topple Zemina Torval from her perch. But what surprised them was Torval’s lack of resistance to this pressure… almost as if she had been planning to step down all along.”\n“I’ve heard that every credit made by selling the shares went straight into the subsidiary that her daughter is running. So maybe all her eggs are going into that basket?”\nIn related news Constantia Torval, operations director for Torval-Mastopolos Mining, made an announcement:\n“I am proud to announce that the people of LTT 198 have elected Torval-Mastopolos Mining to replace LTT 198 State Ltd as their controlling authority. Permits to gain entry to the system can be earned via the Pride of Bitterwood megaship, which remains in the nearby EGM 559 system.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:13:42Z","deprecated":false}
