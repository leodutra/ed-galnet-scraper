Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 544 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nMahei Posse\nHuokang Crimson Dynamic Co\nZaonce Jet Gang\n14 i Orionis Jet Camorra\nLuhman 16 First\nBhumliaurt Blue Brothers\nRevolutionary Songbe Green Party\nEpsilon Indi Party\nEarls of Uzumeru\nCU Cancri Purple Brothers\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:52:44Z","deprecated":false}
