The Federal representatives, the Green Party of Dulos, have said that they will not be contesting the vote.\nThis news will come as quite a blow for President Halsey, whose heavy handed rule of Federal Frontier systems has seen a number of far flung provincial governments start to question the value of maintaining ties with Sol.\nDoubtless this most recent defection will be watched with great interest by powers throughout the galaxy, although exact details regarding a roadmap towards true independence for Dulos has yet to be announced.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:04:39Z","deprecated":false}
