Huge quantities of construction materials were received, which will be used to restore many of the stations damaged by the Thargoids.\nSenior engineer Lilith Galloway made a statement on behalf of Aegis Research:\n“We didn’t expect so many of you to help. But that’s the spirit here in the Pleiades – we come back stronger. Our thanks to everyone who supplied us with what we need.”\nPilots who contributed to this project can now collect their rewards from The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector Ir-W D1-55 system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:39:35Z","deprecated":false}
