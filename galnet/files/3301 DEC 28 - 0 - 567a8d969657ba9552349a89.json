Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 1,304 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nToco Silver Comms Network\nOrder of Njorog\t\nUnited Tellus Order\nBylgit Boys\nBragur United Group\nTZ Arietis Purple Council\nNarakapani One\nApurui Citizens' Forum\nHIP 51197 Central Services\nKruger 60 and Co\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing."}
