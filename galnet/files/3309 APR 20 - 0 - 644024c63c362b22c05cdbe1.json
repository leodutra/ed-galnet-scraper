This has exacerbated hostilities between two long-standing rivals in the Pichch system, causing diplomatic negotiations to collapse.\nThe ruling council of Gauluujja Exchange claimed: “Imperial saboteurs have been undermining our operations for years, and a military solution is now the only option.” A similar statement was made by the Gliese 44 Citizens’ Forum’s leadership: “The typical Federal response to their problems is to blame the Empire, so we are forced to resolve this on the battlefield.”\nThe situation has also impacted the ongoing war against the Thargoids, as outlined in a report by freelance correspondent Karleen Troy:\n“With Maelstrom Leigong’s fleet expansion only a few systems away, Pichch is currently a key distribution point for anti-xeno weaponry and supplies in the region. There is widespread concern that this conflict could disrupt the flow of resources to the front line, hindering defences in multiple systems.”\nBoth Gauluujja Exchange and the Gliese 44 Citizens' Forum have requested help from naval auxiliaries, who can register their support for either faction at Tiptree Port.","extractionDate":"2023-06-23T20:13:25Z","deprecated":false}
