Mass production of the enhanced detailed surface scanner has already begun, and it will be available for purchase from human technology brokers very soon.”\nAll pilots who took part in this campaign can now collect payment from Sirius Corporation at Ashby City in the Luyten’s Star system.","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:46:43Z","deprecated":false}
