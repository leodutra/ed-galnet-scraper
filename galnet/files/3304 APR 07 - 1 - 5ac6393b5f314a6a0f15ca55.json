These modules have been developed by the engineer Ram Tah, following his acquisition of data from Guardian sites.\nPilots can now purchase a Guardian power distributor, a Guardian FSD booster and a Guardian shard cannon. The cannon is available in both fixed and turreted versions.\nAn independent engineering specialist made this comment:\n“These Guardian-human hybrid modules offer additional resilience and firepower – both very welcome to Commanders flying combat missions. By taking advantage of the Guardians’ expertise, we may be able to replicate their success in fighting the Thargoids.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:20:57Z","deprecated":false}
