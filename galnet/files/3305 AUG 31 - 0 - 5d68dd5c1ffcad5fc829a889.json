Advanced security measures have been employed to prevent a repetition of the high-profile incident that occurred in June 3304, where the unique work ‘Youscape’ was stolen from a gallery vault.\nLocal correspondent Daron Warmack reported for The Alliance Tribune:\n“When gallery staff noticed a painting hanging in a previously empty room, they were shocked to recognise it as ‘Penance Street’, the long-lost masterpiece of famous artist Megan Madigan.”\n“Experts have verified that this is the original artwork, which vanished in transit 60 years ago. A graphic of a winking cat was also discovered on the wall behind the picture.”\n“The Winking Cat has returned one of the Alliance’s greatest art treasures – a personal contribution to the festival, perhaps, or maybe an act of penance.”\nThe Alliance Festival of Culture will conclude next week in the Diso system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:16:10Z","deprecated":false}
