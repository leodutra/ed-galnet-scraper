Large quantities of the equipment have been delivered to Wilkes Orbital over the past week for the construction of a new research outpost on Maia A 3 a. In a statement, Professor Palin extended his gratitude to those who supported the campaign:\n\"I am extremely grateful to all the pilots who contributed to this initiative. Now that the necessary materials are in place, I will begin preparing for the next phase of the project. There is still much to be done before I am ready to depart for Maia A 3 a, but with luck it will not take long.\"\n\"Of course, I don't intend to spend all my time on Maia A 3 a studying Unknown Artefacts â€“ I have always enjoyed tinkering with starships, and I plan to spend some time doing just that!\"\nProfessor Palin is expected to depart for Maia A 3 a within the week.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:08:19Z","deprecated":false}
