The campaign was a resounding success, attracting pilots from across the galaxy and resulting in the accumulation of thousands of tonnes of osmium for use in the construction.\nIn a statement, the organisation's spokesperson said:\n\"We're real pleased with the response, and we're going to start work on the outpost just as soon as we can.\"\nThe spokesperson was asked why he thought the galactic community was so eager to establish a permanent presence in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94.\n\"Well the way I see it, people are getting tired of the superpowers and their petty disputes. As a species, we've come a mighty long way â€“ it'd be a real shame if all that progress amounted to was a fight over territory and resources.\"\n\"People want to make a fresh start, and they're thinking Eol Prou could be just the place to do it.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:44:19Z","deprecated":false}
