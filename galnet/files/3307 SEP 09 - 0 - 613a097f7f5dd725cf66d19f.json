The drug is currently distributed in a handful of anarchy systems by the Kumo Crew syndicate.\nAs hostilities erupted in the Haithis system, Archon Delaine broadcast a message for Neomedical Industries:\n“Did you truly believe you could steal from us and survive unscathed? Now your allies will pay for your greed with their blood.”\nIn response, CEO Olwyn Kendrick broadcast a call for help:\n“This terrifying attack by the galaxy’s most vicious pirates may pressure investors to withdraw, causing the entire project to collapse. If so, the vital materials that pilots delivered will be wasted. To prevent this, we urgently require support for our corporate partners against these criminals.”\nThe Haithis Purple Dynamic Group is offering rewards to pilots who help protect its ships against pirate assault. The Kumo Council has also offered to reimburse mercenaries who fight on their behalf.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:19:14Z","deprecated":false}
