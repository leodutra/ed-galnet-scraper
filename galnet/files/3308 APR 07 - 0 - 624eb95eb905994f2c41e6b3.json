These irradiated ores will be analysed to determine their potential commercial value. Samples that were provided from other systems will also be very useful in our comparative studies.”\n“To all the pilots who assisted in this endeavour: thank you! Your hard work is greatly appreciated. The Heart of Taurus megaship will remain in Synuefe CE-R c21-6 for several weeks, and you may collect your rewards from there.”\nTaurus Mining Ventures confirmed that studies to identify the source, effects and application of the local radiation are continuing. The scientific journal The Empirical has reiterated that these ‘atypical radioactive signatures’ have not been independently verified.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:19:01Z","deprecated":false}
