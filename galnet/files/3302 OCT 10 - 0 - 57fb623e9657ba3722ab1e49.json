The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nChamunda Crimson Travel Exchange\nLambda Hydri Industry\nLTT 6714 Company\nLHS 538 Corporation\nLords of the DarkStar Imperium\nLeague of Khruvandji Conservatives\nHand Gang of Apoya\nAulin Silver United Company\nHojin Blue Dragons\nAditi Jet Mafia\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished.
