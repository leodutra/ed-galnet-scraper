Instead, the slaves were transported outside the city and set free.\nThe individual acting as the company’s CEO, Garrett Kline, made the following statement: \n“The true purpose of Tilbery Construction was to provide liberty. As members of the group Autonomy, we renounce institutionalised abuse and fight for human dignity. I am proud to say that we have returned four thousand enslaved people to freedom, so they may live their life however they wish.”\nAutonomy is a network of radical activists opposed to the Empire’s tradition of indentured servitude. It has forcibly liberated slaves on several prior occasions, but never on such a scale.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:08:45Z","deprecated":false}
