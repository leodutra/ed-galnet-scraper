Today, a spokesperson for the organisation announced that the galactic community had delivered huge quantities of aid relief to Bujold Enterprise, currently home of the system's refugees.\nIn a statement, the spokesperson said:\n\"The pilots who supported this campaign have reason to feel proud. Thanks to you, the authorities in Mu Koji will now be able to keep the system's refugees comfortable until they are returned to their homes.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Bujold Enterprise in the Kalana system."}
