Our congratulations to Mr Rackham – we hope he enjoys his billion-credit prize.”\nZachary Rackham, known in some circles as ‘Calico Zack’, told the media:\n“To be honest, this caught me by surprise. I only buy lottery tickets out of habit, a holdover from the days when I used to rattle around space in a rusty old Sidewinder. Naturally I’ll be donating this windfall to various charitable programmes.”\nThe Federal Times published this observation from financial journalist Bryanna Blanco:\n“It’s highly suspicious that a billionaire should play the lottery, and even more suspicious that he should win it. I’m sure that Calico Zack’s accountants will indeed put this money to good use – paying the gargantuan bill for unpaid taxes recently submitted to his company. Once a pirate, always a pirate.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:38:33Z","deprecated":false}
