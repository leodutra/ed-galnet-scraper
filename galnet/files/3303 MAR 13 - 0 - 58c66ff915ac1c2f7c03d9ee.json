When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nNatural Mehit Liberty Party \nSif League \nSocial Ngurii Revolutionary Party \nPeacock Jet Society \nLords of Acihaut \nCaraswang Gold Public Inc \nDemocrats of Masans \nLeaders of Santal \nValues Party of Orishpucho\nV350 Canis Majoris Crimson Society\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished.
