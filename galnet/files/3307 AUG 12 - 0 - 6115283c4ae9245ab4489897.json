It is acting as the operational base for the forces of the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine. \nSupporters of the Marlinism Reformation Party are gathering at the Steel Majesty megaship. This was formerly used by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid to flee from their home system.\nMinister Octavia Volkov announced in parliament: \n“Aaron Whyte and his collaborators are directly responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. I will not rest until they are defeated and brought to justice.”\nMinister Aaron Whyte sent this response from his private vessel:\n“Volkov’s unlawful strike is a violation of our colonies’ charter. We call upon all true Marlinists to defend us from this illegal act of aggression.”\nThe Alliance, Empire and Federation have informed the Marlinist Consulate that they consider this conflict to be a strictly internal matter.","extractionDate":"2021-08-14T03:42:28Z","deprecated":false}
