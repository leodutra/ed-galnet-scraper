We’re currently holding financial talks to acquire a major starport company, so watch this space!”\nOn his role with the Beta Hydri Corporation:\n“It’s a privilege to support my people in Beta Hydri, by helping to run their government. Things are already running smoother after I streamlined a few departments.”\nOn suggestions that he will take part in the Federal presidential election:\n“I’m deeply flattered by calls to stand as an independent candidate. But really, an ordinary guy like me as president? I suppose it indicates that people are looking for something different to what Hudson and Winters offer.”\nOn Bryanna Blanco’s claims that he was once a pirate:\n“Ah, you have to admire Ms Blanco’s tenacity! But ‘Calico Zack’ sounds like a character from an Olav Redcourt novel, doesn’t he? I should thank her for making me look a lot more impressive than I ever was.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:12:36Z","deprecated":false}
