A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for each organisation’s use.”\nThe campaign begins on the 4th of May 3303 and will run for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:34:01Z","deprecated":false}
