What the baroness failed to mention is that Lady Talitha’s name has long been associated with an exclusive gambling circle named Jokers’ Deck.”\n“Some of the wealthiest individuals in the galaxy are believed to be associated with the group, including corporate CEOs, senior politicians, minor royals, pirate lords and cartel kingpins. Several famous names are rumoured to be in Jokers’ Deck, including at least one member of the Rochester family.”\n“Is it possible that Lady Talitha wasn’t kidnapped but is instead hiding in shame, having gambled away the entire Ambrose Foundation?”"}
