After calling on the galactic community to gather data that would support security operations, many pilots handed in anomalous bulk scan data, atypical disrupted wake echoes, exceptional scrambled emission data and unusual encrypted files.\nAll three superpower governments confirmed that due to its success in preparing effective security systems, they will accept Sirius Corporation as the neutral territory for the conference.\nCEO Li Yong-Rui made this announcement:\n“Thank you to all the independent pilots who supported us. Sirius will now begin work preparing for the first Galactic Summit, which we hope will increase peace and prosperity across the galaxy.”\nPilots who delivered to Sirius Corporation can collect their rewards from Goldstein Port in the Lembava system.\nSimguru Pranav Antal expressed disappointment, but confirmed that all who contributed to Utopia’s initiative will be rewarded at Tanner Settlement in the Polevnic system. \nSirius Corporation has stated that the Galactic Summit is provisionally scheduled to take place over a three-week period in late February and early March.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:26:28Z","deprecated":false}
