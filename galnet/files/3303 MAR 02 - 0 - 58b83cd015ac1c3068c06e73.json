Meanwhile, combat pilots neutralised slavers who were attempting to take escape pods from the wreckage.\nAs the operation drew to a close, an Alliance spokesperson made a brief statement:\n\"We are immeasurably grateful to the galactic community for its support. Countless members of Alliance personnel have been spared a lifetime of enforced slavery, and we have you to thank for it.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Acharya Station in the Rahu system."}
