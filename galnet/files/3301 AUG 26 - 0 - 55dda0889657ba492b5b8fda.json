In the last 24 hours, nearly 750 ships have docked at Brunel Station, mostly small or medium transport ships – over 10 times normal volumes.\n\"Word is that the brass is waiting on approval for emergency funds. The pilots’ union rep said we might have to put in some overtime. Nothing I haven't heard before, though\", said Nobu.\nDockworker Sothy Ferrell elaborated on what was drawing pilots to the station: \"Some fruits, some coffee, but mostly tea. How 'bout those monks growing the stuff? No doubt they're loaded!\"\nIt has been reported that a faction called Emperor's Dawn has recently issued a contract for large quantities of ceremonial Heike tea. The group is located over 200 light years from Heike, with most of the journey lying within Federation space.\n\"I might recognize a name or two coming up on the scanner”, said Nobu, “but most of it just runs together. Listen, I gotta get back to my patrol.”\nCommander Tyber de Maat\nZaonce Market Circular | Interstellar Press","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:52:16Z","deprecated":false}
