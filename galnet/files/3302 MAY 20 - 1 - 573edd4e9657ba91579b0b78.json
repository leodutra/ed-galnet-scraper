Starport personnel discovered the individuals attempting to modify the station's frame shift drive.\nA station spokesperson said: \"The individuals are apparently members of a cult that arose shortly after Jasmina Halsey first claimed to have encountered super-intelligent, non-human life. Materials confiscated from the individuals indicate that they hoped to force a mis-jump during Jaques's forthcoming journey to Beagle Point. Apparently they thought this would give them an opportunity to meet Halsey's 'architects'.\"\nThe would-be saboteurs are currently being held in custody at Jaques Station while starport personnel discuss possible extradition with nearby systems.\nJaiotu","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:00:10Z","deprecated":false}
