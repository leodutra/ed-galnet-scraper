The announcement was met with cries of dismay from a crowd of Loren's supporters, who had turned out to hear the verdict.\n\"Ms Loren has been sentenced to life imprisonment at Koontz Asylum in the Daibo system,\" said a court clerk.\nA leaked recording from the press room showed Loren talking with two unidentified men. Their conversation ran as follows:\n\"And what do you want in return for your...favour?\" one man asked.\n\"Patreus's head on a platter,\" responded Loren.\nHaving already been stripped of the title of 'senator', Loren's status as a Lady of the Empire was similarly revoked. She was taken to a secure holding facility after the verdict was announced.\nPrincess Aisling Duval spoke to The Imperial Citizen about the trial:\n\"The woman is clearly deranged. She tried to kill Patreus, but justice has been served. The galaxy is now a safer place.\"\nAdmiral Denton Patreus, emerging from the courtroom, smiled and said: \"They that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind.\"\nAmbassador Cuthrick Delaney, administrator of the Prism system, spoke briefly to The Imperial Herald.\n\"We cannot deny the verdict, but we are dismayed by the outcome. We remain convinced that Kahina Loren is innocent. We will leave no stone unturned in our search for the truth.\"\nMeanwhile, an anonymous source affiliated with the Imperial justice system said: \"It's a de facto death sentence. No one returns from Koontz Asylum.\"","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:11:56Z","deprecated":false}
