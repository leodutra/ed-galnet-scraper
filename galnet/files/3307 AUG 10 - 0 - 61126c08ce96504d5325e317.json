However, Torval’s position as a majority shareholder has allowed her to exert a strong influence on its activities.\nSenator Torval confirmed her plans in a statement to The Imperial Herald:\n“Diversification is an effective strategy in the current business climate. Torval-Mastopolos Mining will have corporate autonomy, while offering the same mining and transportation services to an emergent client base.”\nMarlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica, reported:\n“The persistent rumours of a rift between Zemina Torval and her cousin, CEO Gabriella Mastopolos, may now be validated. Insiders report that after decades of working behind the scenes, Torval wishes to provide a more tangible legacy for her own children. Already she has set her sights on a permit-controlled system as the headquarters for this new company.”\nAs well as being renowned for her private wealth and corporate enterprises, Zemina Torval has been a prominent member of the Imperial Senate for decades. She has occasionally deputised as chancellor, and is known to be an outspoken champion of the Empire’s traditions.","extractionDate":"2021-08-10T17:29:47Z","deprecated":false}
