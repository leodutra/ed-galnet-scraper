He received advanced treatment including Vitadyne nanomeds, and is no longer in critical condition.\nThis unorthodox intervention has drawn both criticism and praise from senators and public alike. Nova Imperium is outlawed for sedition due to its isolationist policies, and its leader is not recognised by the Imperial Family. However, a non-aggression pact was agreed between Aisling and Hadrian in 3305.\nA defiant Aisling Duval told The Imperial Herald:\n“I recently lost one member of my family to these extremists. I am not about to lose another. Regardless of politics, Hadrian is my cousin, and there are precious few Duvals left alive.”\nNova Imperium’s head of security, Praetor Leo Magnus, commented:\n“I am confident that our Imperator would have survived, but we do appreciate Her Highness’s assistance. It remains a mystery how the NMLA could come so close to succeeding, but my investigations continue.”"}
