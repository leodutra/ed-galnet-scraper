This is a public trade route available to all, and features seventeen of the most highly profitable stops in civilised space.\nAlthough profitable trade routes are nothing new, the East India Company spokesperson in charge of the route, a CMDR Bunny, announced that the organisation will provide protection to those traders wanting to benefit, and has even gone as far as to say that arrangements have been made with the Federal Navy, Mercs of Mikunn, the Merchant Marines, and other factions, in order to patrol the route and protect traders.\nThe new route is named after the famous four thousand mile trade route across Earth’s continents of Europe and Asia, first seen over three thousand years ago, where merchants made large profits trading silk cloth, while the wealth helped the emerging cultures along the route to prosper and develop.\nThe stations involved in the new trade scheme are:\nGentil Hub in Harm  \nHiya Orbital in Arjung\nLichtenberg City in Scirth\nOren City in Kaliki\nAustin Market in Bommatsuri\nWeaver Port in Feng Tanga\nCapek Orbital in HIP 9989\nHoutman Dock in Popocassa \nWachmann Vision in Lileni \nGoddard Dock in Xi Wang Mu\nHenson Gateway in Dheneb \nGiunta Gateway in HIP 7916\nGould Ring in HIP 8830 \nHarawi Enterprise in HIP 9753 \nNaddoddur Hub in HR 827\nFabian Term in Badbadzist\nKagawa Vision in Nidayiman","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:41:39Z","deprecated":false}
