You may recall that she highlighted the suspicious deaths of key individuals involved in both the Antares and Starship One investigations before her alleged suicide. Her data detailed an off-the-books investigation into the Antares by Vice-President Nigel Smeaton, and also alleged that he was murdered.\"\n\"Congressman George Fallside's apparent foreknowledge of Smeaton's death was waved away, but I suspect Jacob Harris might have better luck finding Starship One's saboteurs if he searched within the Federation â€“ perhaps starting with folks who have ties to Core Dynamics.\"\nCommander Corrigendum | Loren's Legion","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:22:04Z","deprecated":false}
