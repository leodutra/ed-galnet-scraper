These will be used to produce an armoured layer to protect the weapon against the Maelstroms’ anti-Guardian zones.\nProfessor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, explained more at a press conference:\n“I am well aware that obtaining these substances from the Thargoid spire sites has doubtless cost lives. But the importance of this work cannot be overstated. Without resistance to the Maelstroms’ electromagnetic fields, the weapon based on Ram Tah’s theory is doomed to failure.”\n“The Alliance, Empire and Federation have all agreed to redirect the majority of Aegis funding to the anti-Titan project. We have also drafted in extra help to construct prototypes and fast-track testing procedures. Although details remain classified, if the results continue to be positive, we may be able to go public in as little as a week.”\nAegis has confirmed that all those who contributed to this initiative can now collect their rewards from Austen Town Station in the Arque system.","extractionDate":"2024-02-08T21:50:57Z","deprecated":false}
