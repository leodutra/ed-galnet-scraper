It has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to protect those delivering these rare commodities.\nThe initiative begins on the 6th of December 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:59:36Z","deprecated":false}
