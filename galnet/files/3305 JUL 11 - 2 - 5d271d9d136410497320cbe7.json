Such an operation is incompatible with her principles.”\n“Sandoval also explained that she failed to prevent cartel kingpin Oberon Church from manufacturing the new product, leaving her with no choice but to request help from the proper authorities. For this, I commend her.”\n“Using additional details contained within this testimony, FIA field agents are already engaged in disrupting Red Family operations. We are confident that we can finally bring down this notorious criminal empire.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:37:53Z","deprecated":false}
