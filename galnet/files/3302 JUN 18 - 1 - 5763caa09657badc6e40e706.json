For several months, they have been working together to map the region between the two farthest galactic arms just past the Heart and Soul Nebula.\nCommander Finn McMillan of the Earth Expeditionary Fleet, one of the many Rifters devoted to this project, addressed the galactic exploration community today:\n\"We would like to invite all explorers dedicated to expanding human knowledge to join us in the Formidine Rift. We have reason to believe that there is something beyond the galactic arm that may change humanity's view of the cosmos, but we simply need more eyes, ears and minds to help us unravel this mystery.\"\nJaiotu","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:42:15Z","deprecated":false}
