Where previously there were tens of dozens of independent movements pushing to break away, all but a small handful of them have now fizzled out.\nPundits point to actions taken by Admiral Vincent of the Federal Navy to protect the interests of member states at short notice, as the cause of this most recent shift in opinion."}
