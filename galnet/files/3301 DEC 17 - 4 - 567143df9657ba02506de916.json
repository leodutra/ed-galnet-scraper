Now Jeffress has announced a third treasure hunt, and once again he has promised to reward the winner with a share of his vast personal fortune.\nThe event is expected to follow the same format as the previous two. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. As before, the hunt begins with a riddle, composed by Jeffress, which will lead participants to the mystery object:\n\"To win the prize, follow a story of kings, crowns and jewels, not tall tales told by fools. Your quest to restore the king's crown starts in the middle. Travel where all frequencies of light reside to start solving my riddle.\"\nJeffress has promised that this hunt will be the most challenging yet, having devised even more cryptic clues this time.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:23:11Z","deprecated":false}
