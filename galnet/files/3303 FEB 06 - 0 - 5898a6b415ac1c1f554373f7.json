This means there is probably unique data at each site, and I urge explorers to investigate the codex layouts to ensure no data is missed.\"\nRam Tah also urged independent explorers to deliver any recovered data promptly, as his deciphering software can be applied to Guardian codices for only a few weeks.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:27:14Z","deprecated":false}
