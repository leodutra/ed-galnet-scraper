Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 517 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nDefence Force of Duamta\nWadjetese Crimson Raiders\nWISE 1506+7027 Company\nHIP 27609 Brotherhood\nPSPF-LF 2 Purple Family\nDragons of Kappa Fornacis\nYun Puggera Crimson Posse\nMikinn Gold Federal Industries\nMehuenomici Purple Family\nNew Groombridge 1618 Focus\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened.

A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:21:32Z","deprecated":false}
