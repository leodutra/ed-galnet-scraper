The materials will be used to support further colonisation of the Colonia Nebula, and address the needs of the growing Colonia community.\nA spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement:\n\"This material will help us bolster infrastructure in the system, and support the forthcoming colonisation programme. But more than that, it will help us lay the foundations of a better, brighter future.\"\n\"The future is here, and its name is Colonia.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Jaques Station in the Colonia system."}
