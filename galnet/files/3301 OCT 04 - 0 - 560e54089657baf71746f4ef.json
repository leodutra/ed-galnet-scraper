The Commander was said to have a made a rough landing due to the time that had elapsed since he last experienced docking procedures.\nDuring his ten-month mission, believed to be one of the longest on record, the explorer catalogued information on almost 3,900 star systems, and was awarded a staggering 123 million credits from Universal Cartographics for the data he amassed.\nCore Dynamics, manufacturers of the Eagle Mk II, has expressed an interest in having Commander Kommodore's ship permanently berthed for posterity, and to show just how durable this little ship is.\nCommander Erimus","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:38:40Z","deprecated":false}
