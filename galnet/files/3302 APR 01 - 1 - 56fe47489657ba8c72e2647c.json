Critics of the new technology, developed by Professor Lea Tantaga, have claimed it will facilitate further black-market trade of Unknown Artefacts, thus exacerbating the so-called technological plague.\nIn an attempt to counter the rising concern, a member of the technical team at Obsidian Orbital released the following statement:\n\"I know some people are concerned that these new modules might aggravate the technological plague, but there's every reason to believe we can use the Unknown Artefact-resistant material developed by Professor Tantaga to protect our starports from UA-related malfunctions. All that's needed is for pilots to deliver meta-alloys to the affected starports. We'll do the rest.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:35:29Z","deprecated":false}
