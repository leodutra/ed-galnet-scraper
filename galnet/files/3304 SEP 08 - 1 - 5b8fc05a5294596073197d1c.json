Many others who were researching the Far God sect remain in custody, including leading exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov.\nThe FIA has also shut down the Galactic Interfaith Commune and apprehended its spokesperson, Dr Jameelah Griffin. Several similar organisations, including the Spiritual Freedom Movement, have been closed down.\nIndependent observers have confirmed that the FIA has discovered further empty Far God hive-chapels. The whereabouts of hundreds of adherents remains unknown. In an effort to uncover clues, arrests of associates and family members of Far God worshippers has intensified.\nSenior Agent Micah Whitefield gave a brief statement:\n“We will leave no stone unturned in our mission to identify Thargoid influences. The disappearance of Far God chapters is clearly a coordinated operation of either human or alien design. We warn anyone who may be harbouring cult members that they are impeding a Federal investigation, and will face criminal charges.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:05:40Z","deprecated":false}
