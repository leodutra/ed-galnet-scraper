As a result, all systems controlled by New Kuwembaa Labour will remain independent.\nThis has inspired Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party and Mutumu Future to also sever ties with the Federation, spreading the rebellion across a further 28 systems.\nThe victory was announced by Governor Sonal Mishra, the leader of New Kuwembaa Labour:\n“We owe a huge debt to all pilots who helped us secure our freedom. It is regrettable that we were forced to secede, but this should be a warning to President Hudson that he is taking the Federation down a dangerous path.”\nThe rebelling systems have now shut down links with the Proactive Detection Bureau, which monitors all private and public communications. More Federal factions are now debating secession as the only way to guarantee their citizens’ privacy rights.\nPilots who fought for New Kuwembaa Labour can now claim their rewards from Gagnan Port station. Li Chotep for Equality will reimburse Federal auxiliaries at the Fortress Liberty megaship.","extractionDate":"2021-08-14T03:42:28Z","deprecated":false}
