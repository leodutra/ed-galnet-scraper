Rewards are now available at Payne-Scott City in the Mudhrid system.\nLandgrave Arastin Delacroix, ruler of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, has so far evaded capture. He managed to broadcast this message:\n“Those brave warriors who fought for our cause can receive recompense at the Steel Majesty. One day we will slay the Duvals and bring revolution to the Empire!”\nInspector Mara Klatt of ACT told the media:\n“This is a definite victory against the NMLA. It also provides an insight into their modus operandi – promising disenfranchised or delusional leaders, such as Landgrave Delacroix, increased status in the new Republic should they succeed. We assume they used similar third parties to support the Alliance and Federation bombings.”\n“Our agents are gathering information, but it’s clear that the NMLA’s network is more advanced and widespread than we first suspected.”","extraction_date":"2021-04-18T19:32:28Z","deprecated":false}
