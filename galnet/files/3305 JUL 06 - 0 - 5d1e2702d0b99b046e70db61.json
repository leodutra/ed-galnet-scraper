Many now wield makeshift weapons gathered from the streets.\"\n\"One large group invaded Port Isabelle’s spaceport, causing major disruption to flights. There were scenes of conflict when they attempted to hijack the very ships originally used by Autonomy to transport them.\"\n\"Others have besieged government buildings, demanding to be officially enslaved again so they can complete their terms of servitude. Many emancipated individuals still beg on the streets, despite charitable donations by some citizens.\"\n\"With welfare resources overwhelmed by the immigrants, it can only be a matter of time before more drastic solutions are attempted.”"}
