Winters's leadership of the Liberal Party has been questioned over the last few months, and Halsey could conceivably retake control of the party.\"\nMeanwhile, members of the religious cult known as The Hands of the Architects are holding onto the hope that Halsey will take on the mantle of prophet, and lead them to 'communion with the Architects'.\nAttempts to contact the former president have been rebuffed by her staff.\nJaiotu"}
