Once that was done, doctors were able to develop a course of treatment to fully eradicate all traces of the disease from patientsâ€™ bodies.\nWhile the cure comes too late for the thousands of families in Volungu, Furbaide, Liaedin and LHS 3505 that lost loved ones over the last week, the news doubtlessly comes as quite a relief to the hundreds of thousands more who are currently waiting to receive the cure aboard their local stations."}
