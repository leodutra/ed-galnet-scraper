It is also suggested that resources be set aside for the recovery of Imperial slaves transported and sold outside the Imperium.\nSvetlana Zhukov, chairwoman of the ISA, voiced her support for the regulations:\n“It is our duty to ensure that Imperial citizens serving terms as slaves remain within the borders of the Empire until they are returned to full citizenship. Our hope is that these new regulations will ensure the rights of Imperial Slaves are not trampled on by those unscrupulous enough to sell people for quick credits.\"\nPolitical commentators have expressed doubt that the proposed regulations will be approved, but many remain hopeful.\nCommander Corrigendum\nCapitol Herald | Interstellar Press"}
