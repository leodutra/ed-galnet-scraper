The inquiry will also investigate unconfirmed reports of a rogue battle cruiser outside Federation space in the Maia system.\nSpeaking under condition of anonymity, a source within the closed-door hearing said: \"The scans said it was a Farragut and the Navy said it was a Farragut, but it's not one of ours and it had no clear identification code.\"\nCommander Tyrit Shadowstalker"}
