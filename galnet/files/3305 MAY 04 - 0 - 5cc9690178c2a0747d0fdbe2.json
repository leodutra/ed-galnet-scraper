I have received data suggesting that these transactions were secretly arranged by a senior figure within the Bank of Zaonce.”\n“Regrettably I cannot reveal the source of this evidence since it constitutes part of an ongoing investigation. However, I call upon the Assembly to open an official inquiry to establish if there was any violation of campaign finance law.”\nCouncillor Beck’s proposal was approved by a majority vote, after which Prime Minister Edmund Mahon authorised the inquiry to begin immediately.\nAs yet there has been no comment from President Kincaid.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:02:49Z","deprecated":false}
