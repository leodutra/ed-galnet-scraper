YZ Ceti Blue Galactic and Co, acting on Aegis’s behalf, is distributing rewards and reimbursing bounty vouchers from Clement Orbital in the YZ Ceti system.\nA press conference was held by Aegis leadership, including a statement from Professor Alba Tesreau:\n“The Guardian nanite torpedo is our most important invention yet. Once again, we are utilising the advanced sciences of the Thargoids’ ancient adversary. And once again, we are relying on pilots’ skill and determination to face the Titans at close quarters.”\n“I am painfully aware that many abducted people are still in captivity aboard the Thargoid motherships. Scan results suggest that the majority have now been rescued, but those remaining may not survive these attacks. We are forced to accept that their sacrifice will result in fewer deaths than if the Titans are allowed to remain operational.”\nAnti-xeno strategist Aden Tanner discussed Aegis’s tactical approach:\n“These torpedoes must be aimed at the thermal vents on a Titan’s hull. A sufficiently large payload of Guardian nanites should paralyse these vents. The mothership will be forced to discharge the colossal heat it generates by exposing its inner regions to space. That will provide us with sensitive targets for more conventional weaponry to inflict serious – hopefully critical – damage.”\n“Aegis has marshalled Allied, Federal and Imperial ships to undertake this mission, but we calculate they will not be enough. Only with the support of independent Commanders can we hope to deliver enough nanites to affect each Titan. This could prove to be the most important victory in humanity’s history… or our most devastating defeat. Now, more than ever, we need you all.”","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:25Z","deprecated":false}
