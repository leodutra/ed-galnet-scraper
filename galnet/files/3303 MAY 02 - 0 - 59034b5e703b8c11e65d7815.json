When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nAkbakshu United\nLeague of Ross 1015\nAleutes Bureau\nLeague of Orishpucho Movement\nLeague of 36 Ursae Majoris\nLeaders of Santal\nHIP 86063 Cartel\nOrishpucho Crimson Legal Int\nPapako Crimson Federal and Co\nPeople's LFT 551 League\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending."}
