Princess Duval remains our patron and CEO. We wish Mr Toredo all the best with his future endeavours.”\nReema Falco, a journalist writing for The Imperial Herald, made these observations:\n“Considering Toredo’s passionate rhetoric against Imperial slavery, it’s surprising for him to abandon an organisation that he co-founded. The recent assassination attempt against Princess Duval at an Unchain fundraiser may have caused him to regret allying with such a volatile political figure.”\n“As yet, there is no comment from Her Imperial Highness. This has led to speculation that there was a falling-out between the two. Rumours of a romance between them never quite went away, even after the princess’s engagement to Jordan Rochester. Is this perhaps a jealous rival storming off in a fit of pique?”\nRepresentatives from Unchain have said that their campaigning, fundraising and slave-liberation programmes will continue as normal."}
