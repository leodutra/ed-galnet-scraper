Work has already begun to forge them into beautiful works of art, commemorating past Emperors and other noble holders of the Duval name.”\n“It is my honour to confirm the first two statues will be of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, located in the palace’s central plaza on Capitol, and of Lady Florence Lavigny, placed within the main square of Topaz’s capital city alongside the memorial sculpture of Emperor Hengist.”\nLaedla Empire Assembly is now offering payment to those who delivered the required materials to Kummer Acropolis in the Laedla system. Bounty vouchers for all wanted ships destroyed within the system will also be redeemed.","extractionDate":"2023-10-28T19:26:47Z","deprecated":false}
