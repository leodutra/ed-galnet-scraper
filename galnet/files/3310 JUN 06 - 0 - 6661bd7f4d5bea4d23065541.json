Our president, Zachary Hudson, has done an excellent job maintaining the Federation in spite of this, but we can only do so much.”\n“It pains me to see De Caminha be the target of attacks by criminals looking to take advantage of the Federation’s continued efforts to end the war as quickly as possible, so I am calling on pilots across the galaxy for aid.”\n“I urge you to hunt down the aggressors and supply the Earth Defence Fleet stationed in De Caminha with the medicines and equipment to prevent further attacks. Only by doing both will the station be safe again.”\n“Any help is appreciated, and will be rewarded.”","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:39:12Z","deprecated":false}
