This autocratic behaviour must cease, and Kincaid must cooperate with our investigation or face impeachment.”\nPresident Kincaid issued a response from his private residence in Zaonce:\n“These false accusations are further proof that the Alliance needs a single, strong leader. Unless the Assembly has irrefutable proof of illegality, the constitution states they cannot force me out of office.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:31:11Z","deprecated":false}
