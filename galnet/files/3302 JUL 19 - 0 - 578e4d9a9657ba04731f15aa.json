The pulse is followed by a brief burst of sound, similar in nature to the 'chittering' produced by the Unknown Artefacts.\nFollowing this announcement, Commander Rizal72's colleagues at the Canonn Interstellar Research Group began subjecting recordings of the sound to various tests. They soon discovered that the sound contained an encrypted image, which some have interpreted as a depiction of interstellar bodies.\nThe meaning of the image, and the origin and purpose of the Probes, remains unclear. Clearly, there remains much to discover.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:32:47Z","deprecated":false}
