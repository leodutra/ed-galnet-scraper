The mercenaries were highly trained professionals carrying false identification to bypass initial checks.“\n“It’s clear that they were targeting Sandoval, who is currently in protective custody at FIA headquarters. Fortunately, our security systems exposed the intruders before they could reach her, and the threat was swiftly neutralised.”\n“This assassination attempt reinforces our belief that the information Sandoval offers is not only genuine but also a legitimate threat to the Red Family’s existence. Interviews with Sandoval are ongoing, and we are reviewing her testimony in detail.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:44:06Z","deprecated":false}
