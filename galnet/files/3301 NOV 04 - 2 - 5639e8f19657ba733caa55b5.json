Hundreds of people took part in the competition, but ultimately there could only be one victor.\nAs with Jeffress's previous treasure hunt, competitors were required to solve a series of riddles to find the mystery objects at the centre of the search – a trio of time capsules. The clues took pilots first to Slipher Hub in the Faust 68 system, then to Dickensport in Fomalhaut, and finally to the Cernunnos system.\nWhen the winner was announced, Alfred Jeffress released the following statement:\n\"I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to the winner. You will receive your prizes soon! As for the other competitors, I would once again like to encourage them to remain hopeful – there will be another Jeffress treasure hunt, and next time the winner could be you!\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:28:48Z","deprecated":false}
