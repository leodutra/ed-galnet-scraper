The Lave Jet Family has responded with a rival campaign expressly designed to undermine the Lave Radio initiative, and has invited pilots to deliver commodities to help construct a signal jammer.\nThe two organisations have set out week-long operations to achieve their aims, which will begin on the 7th of June 3304."}
