Specialist farmers from Kappa Fornacis were then able to stimulate the mass growth of Lucan Onionhead clones. \nWhen asked for comment, President Halseyâ€™s office reiterated that Lucan Onionhead is illegal within all Federal jurisdictions and that anyone caught transporting, cultivating or otherwise selling the drug would be subject to prosecution.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:51:13Z","deprecated":false}
