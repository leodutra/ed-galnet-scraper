These groups are allegedly scheming to push corporate governments into power to strengthen trade agreements with Alioth.\nThe Lave system appears to be the latest victim of these efforts. With support from independent pilots, the incorporated Lave Fortune Organization has become the most influential faction in the system. If they are successful, Lave will become the third system in the cluster – after Leesti and Reorte – to have its democratic government overthrown by a corporation.\nThe rise of the Alliance as a galactic power has brought prosperity to the Old Worlds, but commentators fear that its basic principles are being undercut by Edmund Mahon in order to protect trade interests. The Prime Minister’s office has yet to respond to these allegations.\nCommander Kulzar (AKA Léonard Chamberlain)\nAllied News Service | Interstellar Press","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:35:24Z","deprecated":false}
