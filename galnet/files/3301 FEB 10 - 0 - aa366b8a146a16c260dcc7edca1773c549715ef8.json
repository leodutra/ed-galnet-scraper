It won’t be easy establishing a station so far away, but we believe the rewards far outweigh any obstacles that might crop up along the way.”\nPartial construction of the new station will take place in the shipyards of Yembo. Anyone capable of sourcing metals are advised to get themselves over to Naddoddur Terminal - Yembo straight away, as Universal Cartographics are offering some exceptional incentives to Commanders helping with their current construction efforts.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:19:22Z","deprecated":false}
