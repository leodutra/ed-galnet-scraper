Pilots will need to obtain a permit for Alioth to take advantage of this reduction.\nBoth the move and the discount reflect the Alliance’s recent purchase of a majority sharehold in the company. This was primarily to retain it as a key defence contractor for the Alliance Defence Force.\nNaomi Landseer, chairperson of the board of directors, announced:\n“We are extremely pleased to be partnered with the Alliance, especially after recent tumultuous events. Lakon’s highly regarded ships will remain available across the galaxy.”\nThe attempted takeover of Lakon Spaceways by Core Dynamics was revoked due to revelations of illegal practices by its former CEO, Jupiter Rochester. Federal news sources have reported that a rapid restructure is taking place within Core Dynamics, alongside investigations by the Federal Intelligence Agency.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:52:59Z","deprecated":false}
