The presence of gun emplacements by as-yet unknown parties was already a cause for concern, and this worrying development smacks of gunboat diplomacy.\"\nAt least eight Farragut Battle Cruisers are understood to have been sighted in Merope, all identified as Federal.\nDr Arcanonn continued: \"I am morally compelled to insist on a public inquiry examining the deployment of warships to a system that plays home to an insufficiently understood phenomenon.\"\nCommander Nicholas Powell","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:42:15Z","deprecated":false}
