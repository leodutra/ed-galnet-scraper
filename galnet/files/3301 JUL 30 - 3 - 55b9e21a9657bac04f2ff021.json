This happy feeling continued today with Senator Denton Patreus taking his turn to congratulate the Emperor on his return to health and for the upcoming wedding.\n“I have always spoken out for stability in the Empire and we could not have hoped for greater stability than the Emperor’s recovery from his coma. The Empire has suffered with the absence of its father and some have attempted to take advantage of this for their own ends.\n“I have been accused of doing the same, but I can assure everyone that my actions have always been in the best interests of the Empire. I categorically state here and before my esteemed colleagues, that I will do whatever is necessary to support the Emperor in his vision for the future.”\nThe Senator’s speech was well received. However, some commentators have uncharitably noted that his campaign has flagged compared to his rivals’, and that Senator Patreus is trying to set himself as a kingmaker to break the popularity deadlock between Arissa Lavigny-Duval and Aisling Duval.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:32:42Z","deprecated":false}
