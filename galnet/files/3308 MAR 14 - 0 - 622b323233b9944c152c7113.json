It is designed to allow time for Sirius agents to bribe, convince or threaten Allied decision-makers into accepting Li Yong-Rui’s presence. We’d rather become an independent faction than allow this greedy and untrustworthy company into Reorte space.”\nCouncillor Ainsley Niven, who represents Reorte, told the Assembly:\n“Obviously I have argued against this extreme move, but I cannot ignore the strength of feeling from the system’s governing faction. For Reorte Mining Coalition leaders, leaving the Alliance is less risky than allowing Sirius Corporation to become embedded in the system’s infrastructure.”\nVanya Driscoll, political correspondent for The Alliance Tribune, reported:\n“There are already wild rumours that this situation might spark mass declarations of independence, similar to the Federation’s secession crisis last year. But there is no indication as yet that these events will play out quite so dramatically.”\n“What is certain, however, is how damaging this is for Prime Minister Mahon’s campaign to promote acceptance of Sirius Corporation. A historically significant system such as Reorte withdrawing from the Alliance would likely sour the megacorp’s reputation with those it seeks to impress.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:19:57Z","deprecated":false}
