But Professor Violet Belbin of the Xenological Research Institute has expressed doubts:\n\"I would caution against assuming that this material is the answer to our problems. The nature of these 'barnacles' is not fully understood. They could be a form of alien life, and harvesting them could have unforeseen consequences. The Xenological Research Institute is sending a team to Maia and asks that Professor Palin takes our concerns into consideration.\"\nPilots have already started delivering cargo holds full of meta-alloys to Professor Palin's base of operations at Obsidian Orbital.\nCommander Stateira 'Starcloak' Eleshenar\nZandu Science Journal | Interstellar Press","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:55:16Z","deprecated":false}
