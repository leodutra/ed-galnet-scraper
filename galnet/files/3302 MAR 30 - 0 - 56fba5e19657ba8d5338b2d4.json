The event is being funded by a major manufacturer of SRV tyres in exchange for data on high-speed vehicle handling on a variety of planet surfaces.\nFollowing observations that their tyres do not appear to leave tracks, a spokesperson for the company said: \"We've been investigating this anomaly for some time. With the data provided by the BRC, we plan to start developing the next generation of high-performance 'TrakMark' tyres very soon\".\nThe event will run out of Schneider Relay in the Epsilon Indi system from the 2nd to the 10th of April 3302.\nCommander Alec Turner, Buckyball Race Organiser","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:57:25Z","deprecated":false}
