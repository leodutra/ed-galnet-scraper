The Autocracy of Jotunheim has now withdrawn from the system.\nThe success of the resistance operation was due in no small part to the support of Jasmina Halsey. Scores of pilots responded to her request for commodities, which were then donated to Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance.\nAs the conflict drew to a close, representatives of the Revolutionary Jotunheim Resistance and the Yum Kamcabi Purple Life Industry thanked those who supported their operations.\nPilots who participated in the conflict can now collect their rewards from Big Harry's Monkey Hangout in the Jotunheim system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:14:21Z","deprecated":false}
