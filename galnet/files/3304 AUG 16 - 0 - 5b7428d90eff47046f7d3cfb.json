It remained lost for several days before being discovered over a hundred kilometres from where it malfunctioned.\nSecurity Chief Sara Kulkarni gave this report:\n“Our sensor drones detected the robot as it surfaced in the Blue Peaks mountain range. We believe it was obeying its primary programming by homing in on mineral ores. Federal Navy gunships were immediately dispatched. Once located, the robot was partially destroyed from the air before it could cause any further damage.”\nDirector Chen Emerson of MacArthur Mining Ltd commented:\n“An inspection of the robot’s remains confirmed our suspicion that it had been placed in the incorrect standby mode. Its comms array was then disrupted by local signals, activating a pre-set mining program. The DG090 series is very reliable, and this unfortunate incident should not be perceived as a blemish on its excellent reputation.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:15:02Z","deprecated":false}
