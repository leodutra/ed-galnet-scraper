These have been transported directly to the relevant systems, where they will be used to ease the suffering of several hundred thousand civilians.”\nSafeguard Interstellar confirmed that its partner factions have made rewards available at the three systems used as staging areas for deliveries. \nPilots can collect from the Perez Ring Brewery at Krylov Ring in the He Bo system, Lavigny's Legion at Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system, and the Duamta Gold Creative Corp at Davis Terminal in the Duamta system.\nOver the past two weeks, emergency services have been concentrated on the nine damaged starports in the Achenar, Alioth, Eotienses, Gateway, Kamadhenu, Lave, Nanomam, Rhea and Sol systems. All survivors have been accounted for and repairs are largely completed, mainly due to dedicated support by members of the Pilots Federation.","extraction_date":"2021-03-26T13:51:22Z","deprecated":false}
