Commanders who support the campaign will be generously compensated.\nSaool Aledon, a senior operative in the Spinward Marches, released the following statement:\n“We are well aware of the challenges involved in supporting outposts far from the core systems. We want to leverage our expertise to support the Alliance’s operations in the California Nebula, and we hope we have the support of the galactic community.”\nThe campaign begins on the 9th of November 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:26:20Z","deprecated":false}
