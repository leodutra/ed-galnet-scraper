Under that monopoly, progress seems to have stagnated entirely. But Achilles is a corporation built on the iteration and refinement of technology, and we intend to bring space travel into a new age.”\n“We have been limited to observational data alone so far, but that is no longer the case. The remnant of Taranis is now accessible, and within it lies the missing component to our work. We urge pilots to venture to the wreckage of the destroyed Titan and try to obtain one of the rare Titan Drive Components. Achilles Aerospace will pay generously for any that are sold to Bloch Station in the Ethgreze system.” Experts warn that the Taranis site remains extremely dangerous. Caustic sinks should be equipped, and care should be taken due to reports of Thargoid ships active in the area.","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:57Z","deprecated":false}
