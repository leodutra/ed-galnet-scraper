Meanwhile, Colonia’s defensive capabilities remain limited. It is clear to us that the time to act has come.”\nColonia has agreed to fund the operation, and has placed an open order for various mined resources for use in the construction. Pilots who deliver the requested resources to Dove Enigma in the Colonia system will be generously compensated.\nThe campaign begins on the 1st of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
