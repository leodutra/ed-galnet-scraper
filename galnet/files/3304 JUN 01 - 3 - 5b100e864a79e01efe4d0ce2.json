I would like to appeal to the galactic community to restore services in the core systems to their previously high standard.”\nAn open order has been placed for construction materials, which will be shipped to the affected starports and used to make repairs. Pilots are asked to make their deliveries to Dantec Enterprise in the Socho system.\nThe campaign begins on the 31st of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:13:56Z","deprecated":false}
