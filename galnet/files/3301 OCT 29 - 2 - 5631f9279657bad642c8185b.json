Having promised that the first event would not be the last of its kind, Jeffress has announced a second treasure hunt, and once again he is offering a share of his vast personal fortune to the winner.\nAccording to a statement from Jeffress, the event will follow much the same format as the first. A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. As before, Jeffress has released a riddle that he claims will lead participants to the mystery object:\n\"A dissatisfied scholar keeps a visionary in his grasp as he makes his deal.\"\nWith such a generous prize on offer, the event is sure to capture the imagination of the galactic community.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:19:33Z","deprecated":false}
