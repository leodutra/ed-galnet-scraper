In a press conference at the White House on Mars, he said:\n\"The allegations raised by the Federal Times are indeed grave and I have already instructed the responsible agencies to pursue the evidence and determine its veracity. If the evidence proves to be true then the wrongdoers will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\"\nWhen asked by reporters which agency would be responsible for the investigation, he replied that the Federal Security Service would act as the lead agency, but resources from any law enforcement agency would be available to assist.\nShadow President Winters was quick to respond to the President's announcement:\n\"While it is good to see the President responding to genuine concerns, I can't help but notice that he is ignoring our call for an open investigation.\""}
