I knew Vice President Nigel Smeaton personally and he was a good friend - the thought that he was murdered for investigating the death of a family member is repugnant. Our society is one based on truth and freedom and I call upon President Hudson to immediately instigate an impartial and open investigation into these allegations.\"\nHer speech was met with support from both sides of the political divide. There has been no response from the President's office as yet.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:54:27Z","deprecated":false}
