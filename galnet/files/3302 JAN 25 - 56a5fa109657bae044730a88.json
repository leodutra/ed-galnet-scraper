Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 610 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nLTT 5455 Jet Clan\nLeague of George Pantazis Defence Force\nSha Gigas Ltd\nDragons of Urvane\nFuture of Zeta Fornacis\nHIP 18527 Liberty Party\nV1581 Cygni Gold Rats\nKruger 60 and Co\nLHS 215 Purple Galactic Ind\nCordenet Jet Ring\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing."}
