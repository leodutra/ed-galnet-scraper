We will remember his sacrifice on humanity’s behalf, but recognise this as a chance to forge a fresh path towards the future.”\n“Azimuth Biotech is now under new management, with myself as its acting CEO. We have lost a great deal of expertise and personnel, but our decades of xenological research will serve a vital purpose in the war against the Thargoids.”\n“Unfortunately, due to a misguided campaign by radicalised saboteurs, many of our official facilities have been illegally snatched from our control. Yet plans are already underway to rebuild our corporate infrastructure. Of our surviving megaships, the Musashi has returned to our headquarters in the T Tauri system, while the Glorious Prospect has jumped to the LHS 157 system to establish a resource-gathering initiative.”\n“I can assure our former clients in the Alliance, Empire and Federation that Azimuth Biotech is beginning a new chapter in its long and successful history.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:26:03Z","deprecated":false}
