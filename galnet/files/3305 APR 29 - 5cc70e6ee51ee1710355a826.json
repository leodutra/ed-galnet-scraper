This will involve the construction of a megaship to transport pilots to and from this comparatively inaccessible region.”\n“Five systems have been highlighted as potential destinations, and we’d like to invite the galactic community to decide which of these should serve as the termination point for the megaship. We will then build an outpost in the chosen system, and the megaship will enter service.”\n“We hope that this initiative will stimulate new innovations in the field of Guardian-human technology.”"}
