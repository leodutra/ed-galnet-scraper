The materials needed for the final phase of construction have been delivered, and the finishing touches are now being applied to the Kaushpoos system's new Ocellus starport. A spokesperson for the Explorers' Association expressed satisfaction with the result, but stressed that the starport was not yet open for business:\n \"I want to take this opportunity to thank the many hundreds of independent pilots who supported this project, and helped make our dream a reality. There's still work to do, but we're on schedule to officially open the starport next month. We look forward to seeing you at the opening ceremony!\"\nIn keeping with the public-spirited nature of the project, the name of the starport was decided by public vote. The result was 'Obsidian Orbital'.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:37:35Z","deprecated":false}
