The next step is to procure a licence that will allow a technology broker to trade from The Prospect.”\n“In preparation for this, we invite the galactic community to collect Guardian commodities from nearby ancient ruins and bring them to the outpost. This will allow us to provide a stock of existing Guardian-human technology, while also stimulating further studies into this extinct civilisation.”\nDeliveries should be made to The Prospect in the Synuefe EN-H d11-96 system.\nThe appeal begins on the 16th of May 3305 and will run for one week. If the maximum requested total is achieved earlier than planned, Zende Partners will end the campaign immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:49:57Z","deprecated":false}
