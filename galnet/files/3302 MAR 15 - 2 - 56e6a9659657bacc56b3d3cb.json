Engalo has observed that if you place an artefact near a barnacle, their respective fireflies start flying around together. This continues until the UA is removed.\"\n\"I can't thank Commander Engalo enough for bringing this to my attention. With the new lab the community is helping us build, we'll soon be able to observe this behaviour under controlled conditions.\"\nCommander Lord Zoltan","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:05:15Z","deprecated":false}
