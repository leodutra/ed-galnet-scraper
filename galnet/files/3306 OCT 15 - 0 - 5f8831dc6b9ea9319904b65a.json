This initially triggered a hostile reaction from the Thargoids, but their presence was relatively low until now.\nCaptain Warren Lamar, head of security for the Alliance Expeditionary Pact, put out an urgent call for assistance:\n“If this Thargoid assault is not repelled, it may spread into a full-scale invasion throughout the Witch Head Enclave. Neither Aegis nor the Alliance Defence Force are able to deploy in time, so we ask all independent combat pilots and anti-xeno squadrons to come to our defence.”\nThe Alliance Expeditionary Pact has confirmed that it will offer generous rewards to all Commanders who assist with destroying Thargoid vessels.\nIn related news, the technology broker at Bray Landing in the Yuanjia system will support pilots by reducing resource requirements to access Guardian weapons and modules.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:35:42Z","deprecated":false}
