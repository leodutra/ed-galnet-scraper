Achenar's third planet has become a proving ground where bragging rights are earned in what is known as the 'Achenar Challenge'.\nProctor Ulrich von Braun, whose only concern until recently was the safety of Imperial Naval Academy students during high-g training, posted the following advisory:\n\"The force of gravity on the surface of Achenar 3 is approximately 6.7 times that of Earth. Any who wish to hazard this so-called 'Achenar Challenge' are advised that they do so at their own risk. Pilots accustomed to landing on planets in the 3-4 g range are much more likely to alight here safely. Underestimate Achenar 3 and you may never leave.\"\nOver 100 craft have crashed on Achenar 3 since mid December.\nCommander Corrigendum","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:15:00Z","deprecated":false}
