If approved, Hudson would become eligible for re-election in June 3309.\nA statement was delivered by President Hudson:\n“I have agreed that more time is needed to analyse the potential repercussions of this change to the Federation’s constitution. A congressional subcommittee will perform a detailed inquiry to investigate the civil and legal aspects.”\n“In addition, I am very conscious of the public disturbances caused by the Hudson Contravention. This delay should help to defuse political tension and provide our security services with an opportunity to keep the peace.”\nShadow President Winters welcomed the president’s decision, and spoke of her eagerness to read the subcommittee’s report.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:11:21Z","deprecated":false}
