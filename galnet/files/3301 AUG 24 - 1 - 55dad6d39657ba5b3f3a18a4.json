Boom can also positively increase a minor faction’s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 46 minor factions experiencing an economic bust:\nZandu Jet Syndicate\nDemocrats of LTT 4961\nChi Orionis Vision Organisation\nOvid Defence Force\nRoss 490 Justice Party\nLaw Party of CD-51 102\nIsleta Transport Incorporated\nHIP 51197 Central Services\nCD-35 9019 Liberals\nLalande 38451 Creative PLC\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction’s influence is also lessened.
