Bonuses will be awarded depending on ship size, meaning some very large ships will be squeezed through some very tight spaces.\nThe Buckyball Racing Club refused to address rumours that the race will use Federal and Imperial capital ship docks as gates.\nThe event starts on Saturday the 25th of February and will run until Monday the 6th of March.\nAlec Turner","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:43:21Z","deprecated":false}
