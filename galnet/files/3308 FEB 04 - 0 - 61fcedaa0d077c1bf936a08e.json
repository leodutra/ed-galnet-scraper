President Hudson assumed the role in June 3301, and is therefore due to step down in June 3309 following an election to select his replacement.\nSecretary of State Lana Berkovich delivered the proposal to Congress:\n“We live in extraordinary times, and all signs point to further challenges in the coming years. Our people deserve a steady hand at the helm rather than being forced to change political course, especially with the tempestuous developments found within our neighbouring superpowers.”\n“It is therefore in the public interest that we temporarily suspend the arbitrary eight-year limitation, to allow President Hudson to continue steering the Federation through the coming storms.”\nShadow President Felicia Winters condemned the proposal:\n“Hudson has already violated the Federal Accord with his surveillance laws, but now we can see how little he values our constitution. This is the act of a dictator, not a democratically elected president.”\nA few Republican congressmen reluctantly agreed with Winters, joining calls for President Hudson to withdraw the proposal. However, political analysts believe that Hudson enjoys the support of his entire Cabinet and a majority of the Republican Party.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:13:51Z","deprecated":false}
