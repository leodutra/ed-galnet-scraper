The coming week brings promise of conflict, as Federal military contractors seek to establish a permanent presence in 26 Ophiuchi and Orishvati.\nThough Ch'iang Fei ultimately rejected Shadow President Winters' efforts to secure support for the Liberal party, citizens in LTT 5964 were much more receptive. Djanharu, HIP 50489 and LHS 2205 are currently the focal points of comprehensive Federal aid campaigns.\nThe Empire:\nWith the exception of Princess Aisling Duval's territory, the political climate in the Empire remained relatively stable this week. The citizens of Aluriates, Erisha, HIP 116710 and Karakasis withdrew their formal support from the People's Princess, reducing the number of systems under her sway to 56.\nEmperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's staff investigated a number of systems this week, ultimately settling on Hyades Sector IC-K b9-4 and Kherthaje as the subject of the coming week's anti-criminal efforts. The Shield of Justice is already active in both systems.\nSince there were no acquisitions on the table this week, Senator Zemina Torval's agents focused their efforts on establishing good relations in HIP 88178 and Mantunt. Having had some success, Senator Torval's brokers are now looking to purchase assets in both systems.\nSenator Denton Patreus' forces were largely tied up protecting the new Majestic-Class Interdictor under construction in Mundjiga. Patreus' fleets have since been dispatched to Ts'ai Shai, and are expected to remain active there for a week.\nThe Alliance:\nAlliance diplomats clocked up thousands of light years this week, diligently pursuing trade ties with seven key systems. New trade relationships were established with Akheilos, Aranbarahun, FAUST 3566 and Gendalla. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon is pursuing trade partnerships in 3 Upsilon Ophiuchi, Bingui, Gitse, Kaal, LFT 820, Marralteki, Mongatha, Ross 860 and Tricorii. Should diplomatic efforts in all nine systems prove fruitful, the Alliance trade network will boast a total of 99 commercial hubs.\nIndependents:\nUtopian agitators prevailed in violent protests in the HIP 10584 system, and a Utopian embassy has subsequently been established there. Simguru Pranav Antal's supporters are currently active in Allowa, Antanyamai, HIP 6943 and Maia. Should these systems join Utopia, Antal's influence will extend to a total of 55 key systems.\nThe Kumo Crew's insurrections in 7 Zeta-2 Lyrae, Dhanchu and HIP 103138 were suppressed, but authorities in the San Guan system were brought under the control of Pirate Lord Archon Delaine. The Kumo Crew has now shifted its efforts to Latugara and Ross 151.\nSirius Gov CEO Li Yong-Rui leveraged his connections with Sirius Corp to encourage spending and investment in Babaradhbh and Chang O. Corporate vessels have been dispatched to begin buying up private and government assets in an attempt to establish a permanent Sirius Gov presence.\nCommander Corrigendum","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:39:48Z","deprecated":false}
