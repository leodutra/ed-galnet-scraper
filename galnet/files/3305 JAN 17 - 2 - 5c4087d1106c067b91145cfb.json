A spokesperson for the IHO said:\n“We accept that this product is based on nanomedicines developed by Utopia, as asserted by Simguru Pranav Antal. But our ruling is that because they were obtained as lawful salvage, the nanomeds recreated by Vitadyne Labs are its intellectual property.”\n“All restrictions have been lifted, with the caveat that distribution must be handled by an established pharmaceutical company. This will ensure that strict healthcare protocols can be applied at every stage.”\nProfessor Katrien Rook told the media she was happy to comply with the Interstellar Health Organisation's conditions.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:37:05Z","deprecated":false}
