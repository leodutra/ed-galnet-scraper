The corporation has performed activities on Salvation’s behalf, including preparation for the anti-xeno weapon used to eliminate all Thargoids from the Cornsar system.\nAdmiral Tanner transmitted this message to media outlets:\n“Salvation’s unlicensed weapons technology is deliberately designed to provoke the Thargoids, risking millions of lives. My sources tell me that Hind Mine asteroid base contains evidence of this. I therefore demand that Taurus Mining Ventures allows us access so we can determine the truth.”\nPatience Middleton of Taurus Mining Ventures responded:\n“We are a legitimate business under contract to a private citizen, whose activities are protected by confidentiality agreements. These threats have no legal standing and are not welcome.”\nAdmiral Tanner is a highly decorated Federal Navy officer and Aegis’s chief military liaison, having coordinated many combat efforts against the Thargoids. The Musashi’s relocation has been condemned by Aegis leadership, and Tanner has been ordered to depart the T Tauri system.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:25:12Z","deprecated":false}
