At the group’s most recent event, she bet the entire Ambrose Foundation during an epic game of high-stakes deadlock poker, and eventually lost. Lady Talitha was apparently devastated, fleeing the venue soon after.”\n“Some attendees believe that the game was rigged by one or more other players, who aimed to exploit Lady Talitha’s well-known gambling addiction.”\n“The organisers of Jokers’ Deck remain anonymous and untraceable, so retrieving the family’s assets is unlikely.”\nAn Ambrose Foundation spokesperson later stated that Baroness Oksana has officially revoked Lady Talitha’s title, vowing never to speak to her daughter again.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:53:19Z","deprecated":false}
