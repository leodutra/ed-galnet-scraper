Fighter wings have also been scrambled to provide safe passage for pilots carrying medicine and to enforce quarantine on local citizens.\nWhen asked about the extreme measures they are employing the younger brother of the Dukes, Caius, stated: \n\"When we had to deal with the infamous plague of HR 7327 our thoughts went to the people first and foremost, but by not locking down the system and enforcing quarantine the plague had spread to all nearby systems. For weeks we dealt with the same plague in Mikunn, Sukua and Sefry's on top of HR 7327. It was then that we realized that enforcing quarantine would benefit the people more than not enforcing one. The current spread of the epidemic is due to the failure of the powers to act in the best interest of their own people.\"\nMercenary wings are expected to arrive later today and will remain within the affected systems until the outbreak has been dealt with.\nCommander Exil","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:49:18Z","deprecated":false}
