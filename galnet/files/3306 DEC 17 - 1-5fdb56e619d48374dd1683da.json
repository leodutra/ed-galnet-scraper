The shipments of atmospheric processors, auto-fabricators, structural regulators and water purifiers will be used to construct new outposts and settlements in 8 uninhabited systems.”\nThe Omega Merchant Command is now offering rewards at Ellis Gateway in the Bd+05 1146 system to all pilots who delivered commodities.\nAaron Whyte, a community leader among the refugees, commented on Vox Galactica:\n“I suppose we should be grateful that these colonies give us a chance of survival. But none of us wanted to set up our own kingdoms – only to remove the kings. And one day, we will.”\nThe Marlinist population is expected to be transferred from Federal space to the new colonies in early 3307."}
