The newsfeed has been permanently dissolved, and the Cordova Group conglomerate subjected to a government audit.”\n“I would like to thank the anonymous whistle-blower who exposed Cordova’s scheme. She has now removed the surveillance program from all Achilles Corporation PA912 robots in exchange for immunity from prosecution.”\nChief Editor Lena Ravenhill wrote in The Federal Times:\n“The Mars Tribune abandoned its professional ethics in its hunt for salacious headlines, thereby undermining the role of honest journalism in our society. We are relieved to see justice done.”"}
