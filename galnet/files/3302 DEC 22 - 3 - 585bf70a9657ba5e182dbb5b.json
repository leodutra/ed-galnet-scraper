As we speak, hundreds of animals are being grown in special in vitro chambers. Soon they will be transported to the reserve.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Whitson Orbital in the LP 339-7 system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:53:17Z","deprecated":false}
