I'm surprised the Canonn Institute hasn't considered it. The creature was obviously confused by frame shift emissions, and beached itself while looking for food.\"\nWhile answering viewers' questions, Ulla dismissed suggestions that the remains were dangerous or indicative of the existence of intelligent life.\n\"The chances of anything coming from the Pleiades, or beyond, are a million to one. Other than the space trees the Federation is guarding, there's nothing in that remote, forbidding area. The Unknown Probes are nothing more than space fungi. The Canonn should stop misleading people with its pseudo-science.\"\nCommander Gan\nOgilvy Observer | Interstellar Press","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:19:19Z","deprecated":false}
