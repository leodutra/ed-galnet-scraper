We are therefore watching the situation closely.”\nIn Congress, President Zachary Hudson said:\n“If Nova Imperium comes to power and the Empire ceases contributions to Aegis, our combined defences against the Thargoid threat will be jeopardised. In such a case, the Federation would be forced to intervene in order to safeguard humanity’s future.”\nIndependent sources have confirmed that Federal Navy resupplies have increased in frequency. Fleet manoeuvres have also taken place in regions bordering Imperial territory.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:11:20Z","deprecated":false}
