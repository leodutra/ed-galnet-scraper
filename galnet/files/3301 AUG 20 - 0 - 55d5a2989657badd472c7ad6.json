The Empire was founded on the principle of a representative democracy, one in which senators – duly elected by the people – carry out the peoples' will. Marlin Duval would be ashamed of how her noble vision has been twisted and corrupted by her brother and his progeny.\"\nThe statement went on to lament that none of the current claimants seem qualified to \"restore liberty and honour\" to the Empire, although the statement did say that \"ironically enough, Aisling Duval embraces the most democratic methods, and goals, of all the claimants. Perhaps if she embraced the aim of returning the Empire to its democratic roots, the lovers of freedom in this galaxy would have someone they could actually support.\"\nCommander Virgil Kyle","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:35:24Z","deprecated":false}
