But while its new home has become a haven for miners and traders, one thing is missing: a reliable source of food. The Kuun-Lan has therefore announced plans to establish an agricultural network in HIP 104292, and is calling on the galactic community for support.\nThe organisation has reserved generous reimbursements for pilots who contribute atmospheric processors, crop harvesters, land enrichment systems, building fabricators, animal monitors and aquaponic systems to the initiative.\nA spokesperson for the group released the following statement:\n\"We hope the galactic community will heed our call and help us secure our independence. If we can successfully complete this campaign, we can improve living standards for millions of people.\"\nThe campaign begins on the 5th of October 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:44:41Z","deprecated":false}
