Many traders delivered a huge quantity of construction material to Bobko City, which will be used to build defences for the Sim-Archive. Other independent pilots protected the operation by eliminating pirate vessels.\nUtopia’s spokesperson, Dr Leigh Constantinides, expressed her gratitude:\n“On behalf of Utopia, I would like to thank everyone who worked so hard to support this project. We hope that this will safeguard the Sim-Archive for the benefit of all our descendants.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Bobko City in the Narri system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:50:57Z","deprecated":false}
