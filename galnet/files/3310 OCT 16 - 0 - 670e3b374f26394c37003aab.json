Achilles Aerospace has delivered a marvellous device which greatly amplifies the travel speeds of small spacecraft within a star system.”\n“But the reality is that the scientific community is exploring further applications of this xeno material. For example, the Titans design has mastered thermodynamic efficiency. The exchange of energy to power while distributing heat away from core components is so effective it has essentially redrawn the map of our understanding.”\n“If we can harness this efficiency into large-scale manufacturing, say, it’ll offer so many opportunities. Industrial installations could work harder and faster without compromising safety. Raw resources processed into finished products at higher rates could reduce consumer costs and increase accessibility.”\n“It’s quite an exciting time for research, industry and corporations of all sizes.”","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:39:03Z","deprecated":false}
