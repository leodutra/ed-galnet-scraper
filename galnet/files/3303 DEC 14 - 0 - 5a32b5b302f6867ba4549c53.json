Scores of pilots contributed to the campaign by delivering materials to Skvortsov Orbital, and by eliminating agitators in the 63 G. Capricorni system. The materials will be used to construct new outposts in the Colonia region to support a recent influx of immigrants.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, the Colonia Council issued the following statement:\n“Colonia has always enjoyed the support of the galactic community, and the success of this initiative proves this support has not diminished. We will now set to work creating homes and employment opportunities for our new friends and neighbours.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Skvortsov Orbital in the 63 G. Capricorni system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:47:23Z","deprecated":false}
