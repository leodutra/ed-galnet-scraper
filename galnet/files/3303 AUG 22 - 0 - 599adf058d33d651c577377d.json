Once complete, this new ship will gather data on stellar bodies and unusual celestial phenomena.\"\nThe Kpelidoog Empire Assembly has placed an open order for titanium, semiconductors and power generators for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Hipparchus Terminal in the Kpelidoog system.\nThe spokesperson went on to say:\n\"The success of this initiative depends largely on the support of the galactic community. That's why we've decided to incorporate the name of the pilot who makes the largest contribution into the name of the new vessel.\"\nThe campaign begins on the 21st of August 3303 and will run until the 24th of August 3303. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:14:34Z","deprecated":false}
