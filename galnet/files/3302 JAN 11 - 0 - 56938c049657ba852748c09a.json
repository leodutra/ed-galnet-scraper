Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 978 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nRoss 720 Crimson Cartel\nLusonda Society\t\nKamorin Network\nChielas Travel Industries\nRaiders of Summerland\nSamen Citizens' Forum\nNidarijedi Empire Party\nHIP 108598 Comms Company\nNew Kali Law Party\nCamorra of Epsilon Eridani\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:58:06Z","deprecated":false}
