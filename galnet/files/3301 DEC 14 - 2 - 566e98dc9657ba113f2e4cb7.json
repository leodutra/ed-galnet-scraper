Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 1,509 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nKorovii Purple Comms Limited\nDefence Force of Giryampi\nBaker Confederacy\nUru Bureau\nHirapa Blue Camorra\nPeople's Party of Asoorajara\nNobles of Lacaille 9352\nBureau of Zeta Aquilae\nGreen Party of Diso\nBhritzameno Regulatory State\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:57:20Z","deprecated":false}
