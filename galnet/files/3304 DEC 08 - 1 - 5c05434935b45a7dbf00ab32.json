So the existence of two such settlements, on Etain 4a and 4c, proves that much remained hidden from me.”\n“The personal logs recovered from the outposts illustrate how the faith attracted people from varied backgrounds. I was astonished to hear the voice of a man with whom I once eagerly discussed the Far God’s arrival, never realising that he was a Federal agent whose devotion was as fake as my own.”\n“The book I am co-writing with Dr Alfred Ulyanov will reveal much about the Far God religion, but it’s clear that many of its mysteries are yet to be uncovered.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:02:46Z","deprecated":false}
