In a statement issued during a rare appearance on ‘Face the People’, the President had this to say about her current situation: \n\"I am deeply disappointed by Mr Hudson's conduct. Have mistakes been made? Perhaps. But I say to you, any mistakes that were made, were made worse due to the constant interference of certain parties within our own ranks.\" \n\"As President, the command of our armed forces falls to me, but it does not fall to me alone. The idea that I, personally, am responsible for the Federal Navy's failure to properly secure their supply lines is patently ridiculous. As is the accusation that I am somehow responsible for pilots properly identifying their targets before murdering thousands of our civilians. I have no doubt the residents of our great Federation are smart enough to know what's really going on here.\"\n\"I am proud to serve as your President and I intend to do so for a very long time to come.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:59:42Z","deprecated":false}
