It can also positively increase the minor faction’s influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they run out or some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 93 minor factions currently experiencing an economic bust:\nWolf 1301 Crimson Electronics\nLTT 9097 Gold Advanced Co\nLHS 1197 Gold Family\nHR 692 Empire League\nHR 826 Movement\nOfficial AZ Cancri Dominion\nMob of Groombridge 34\nNLTT 12619 Confederacy\nForculus Ltd\nValues Party of Jitani\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction’s influence is also lessened.
