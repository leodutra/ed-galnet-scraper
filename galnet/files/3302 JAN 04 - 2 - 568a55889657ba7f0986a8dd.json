Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 950 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nSantjalan Labour\nBureau of LHS 6027 Liberty Party\nGlusargiz Energy Exchange\nCD-66 2585 Purple Cartel\nWolf 1458 Society\nAurgel Silver Hand Gang\nSvanticani Purple Public Prtnrs\nHIP 24968 Energy Corp.\nWuluwait Boys\nCD-70 19 Public Incorporated\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing."}
