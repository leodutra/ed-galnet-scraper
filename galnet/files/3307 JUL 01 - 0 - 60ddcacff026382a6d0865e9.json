The faction strenuously opposes government monitoring of Federal citizens’ private communications.\nThree other Federal factions are on the verge of declaring independence: Coalition of Uteran, Lp 726-6 Free and Gluscap Labour. All are closely monitoring the situation in Azaladshu and considering their next move.\nMayor Constanza Noguera, leader of Azaladshu Free, made this statement:\n“We refuse to accept the Federation’s draconian surveillance laws. I call upon all supporters of independence to help us fight for our sovereignty!”\nThe declaration brought a swift reaction from President Zachary Hudson:\n“As Azaladshu Free has violated the Federal Accord, I have no option but to order Neche Inc to engage with these criminals. Thanks to advance intelligence on the secession, we were able to establish the megaship Fortress Liberty in the system to help retake it for the Federation.”\nIn Congress, Shadow President Felicia Winters faced criticism for allowing the secession to occur within her sphere of influence. She reiterated that she does not support rebellion, but does consider the Proactive Detection Bureau to be unconstitutional.","extractionDate":"2021-07-12T21:46:03Z","deprecated":false}
