Only members of the Assembly can cast votes in this election, but they will be heavily influenced by public opinion within their systems.\nMahon’s campaign has focused on the Alliance’s huge expansion during his six-year premiership, with reminders of triumphs such as the Alliance Festival of Culture. His ability to handle a crisis has also been highlighted, including President Kincaid’s attempted coup and the League of Reparation’s crusade.\nMore recent examples of his leadership are welcoming Marlinist refugees from the Empire and exploiting the Coalsack Nebula to boost economic prosperity. However, Mahon’s critics have pointed out that both strategies increased the risk of attack from Neo-Marlinist terrorists and the Thargoids.\nAddressing a packed conference hall on Birmingham in his home system of Diso, Mahon proclaimed:\n“We live in an increasingly turbulent galaxy, making it important to maintain a steady hand at the wheel. I will be honoured to continue representing the diverse peoples of the Alliance.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:23:44Z","deprecated":false}
