You can now collect your rewards at Payson Hub in the Zearla system.”\nAn announcement was also made by the Sirsir Co, which coordinated a similar supply campaign for the Imperial Navy:\n“You have performed a great service for the Empire. Payments have been authorised at Mitchell Hangar in the Sirsir system.”\nMarquis Felix Novantico, a retired military strategist, commented:\n“Tensions caused by Nova Imperium have triggered much activity of this kind. But for the Federation to do the same suggests concern about a potentially hostile Empire, should Hadrian Duval claim the throne.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:10:38Z","deprecated":false}
