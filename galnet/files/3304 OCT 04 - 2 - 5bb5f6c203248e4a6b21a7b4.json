As a result, Mrs Bishop’s congressional campaign has collapsed.”\n“There has also been a sea change in attitude within Congress itself. The majority of members have now taken a stand against Mrs Bishop for cultivating civil unrest and violating the Federation’s principles of religious freedom.”\nJuanita Bishop gave a forceful statement to the media:\n“If Congress can’t see that these people are dangerous, then they’re fools. These Thargoid spies need to be rounded up and executed before they murder us all. History will prove me right!”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:58:32Z","deprecated":false}
