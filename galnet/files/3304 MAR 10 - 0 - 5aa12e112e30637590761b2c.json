Each installation is attended by a comms beacon that will collect the data before transmitting it to us for analysis.”\nAegis has confirmed that Eagle Eye installations have been placed in the following systems:\nHIP 17225\nHIP 17692\nHIP 17892\nHR 1185\nPleiades Sector IR-W d1-55\nPleiades Sector KC-V c2-4\nProfessor Alba Tesreau commented:\n“My hope is that this initiative will greatly increase our knowledge of the Thargoids. Observing their ‘natural’ activities, outside of combat zones, should further our understanding of their behaviour.”"}
