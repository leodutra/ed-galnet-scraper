I have no doubt that Sirius would aim for maximum profits, rather than using the knowledge to aid humanity.”\n“Using tech brokers to distribute the designs allows them to be widely available, and thanks to the generosity of Aegis, the tech brokers’ costs have been reduced, making Guardian-human fighters and systems more affordable.”\nLi Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, has stated that his offer remains open, and that he hopes Ram Tah will have a change of heart.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:26:35Z","deprecated":false}
