Those rescued from the shipwrecks are now recovering at Darwin Research Facility.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, the Alliance released a statement:\n“We are immeasurably grateful to those who participated in this operation – you have saved our allies from a terrible fate.”\n“A pertinent question remains unanswered, however. Where did these criminals come from? Alliance intelligence has surmised that they may have been driven out of their home systems by a second group of agitators. If this is the case, this latter group could represent an even greater threat to civilised space.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Darwin Research Facility in the California Sector BV-Y c7 system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:02:28Z","deprecated":false}
