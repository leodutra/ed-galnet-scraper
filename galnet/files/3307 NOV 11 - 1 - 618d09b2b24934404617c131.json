These additional ports should be operational by the 25th of November, making journeys to and from Colonia easier and safer.”\n“Pilots can now collect their rewards from Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. We shall also be awarding an engineered frame shift drive with long range and fast boot to the majority of contributors.”\nThe top ten pilots who delivered materials to Alcor and Colonia will shortly be invited to submit suggestions to name the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. To ensure a variety of choice, only pilots who have not yet submitted names for the Colonia Bridge megaships will be eligible.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:14:22Z","deprecated":false}
