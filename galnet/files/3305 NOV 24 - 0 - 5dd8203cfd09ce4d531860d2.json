The outpost will be named Forester’s Choice to honour the captain of the Golconda, Jonathon Forester. \nThe Golconda crew have also accepted the status of a Federal partner while retaining their autonomy.\nCongressman Harlan Turk made this statement:\n“We are proud to offer a fresh start to a society descended from the Federation’s forebears. Their unique culture will continue to thrive among the stars at an outpost that enjoys Federal protection.”\nImperial Senator Ava Cornelius sent a message of goodwill to Captain Forester and his crew. She admitted disappointment at the Golconda’s decision but wished the colonists peace and prosperity for the future.\nSupporters of the Imperial and Federal campaigns can now collect outstanding rewards from their respective megaships in the Upaniklis system."}
