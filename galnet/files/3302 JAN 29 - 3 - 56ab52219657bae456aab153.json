The origin of the messages is not clear, but they share certain characteristics, including references to apparent criminal activity, and in some cases coordinates. Often the messages are partially corrupted, suggesting they were originally hidden in the news feeds in an encoded form. Precisely why the messages have started surfacing in the public news channel is unclear.\nAre these messages genuine criminal communiqu√©s, or merely a creative hoax? We leave you to decide.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:16:35Z","deprecated":false}
