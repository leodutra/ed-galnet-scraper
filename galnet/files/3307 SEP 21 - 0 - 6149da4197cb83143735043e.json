Her only complaint was that she’s no longer allowed to fly support missions for Nova Imperium. Once a Commander, always a Commander!”\nMainstream media channels also commented on the news.\nThe Imperial Herald: “This has caused tangible ripples of unease in the Senate. Since neither Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval nor Princess Aisling Duval have heirs, Hadrian’s claim to the throne will be strengthened if he alone ensures that the Duval bloodline continues.”\nEye on Achenar: “Who cares about the spawn of Emperor Hengist’s illegitimate grandson? The NMLA may have assassinated much of the Imperial Family, but this outcast boy is still a footnote in their noble history.”\nVox Galactica: “Despite his unofficial status, Hadrian Duval has many silent supporters within the Empire. His isolationist stance appeals to nostalgic citizens, as does returning to the tradition of male Emperors. Should Hadrian have a son, he may feel empowered to seek his birthright more forcefully.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:28:39Z","deprecated":false}
