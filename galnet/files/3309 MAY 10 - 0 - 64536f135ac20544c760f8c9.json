Until now, this has prevented all attempts to identify what Thargoid constructs may exist within the caustic clouds.\nRear Admiral Daniel Parry, the Federal Navy’s liaison to Aegis, reported:\n“Armed ships crewed by military and xenology specialists have now been sent into each Maelstrom. These pathfinder missions will attempt to gather as much tactical and environmental data as possible.”\n“We have also received information from Commanders who returned intact from the Maelstroms’ core areas. We are unable to authenticate these accounts at present, but they are being collated and analysed. The Allied, Federal and Imperial high commands will authorise an official report in due course.”\nA secondary statement was provided by Commodore Emil Varga, the Alliance’s military liaison:\n“If the preliminary data obtained by independent pilots is accurate, one common factor is that they encountered a significant Thargoid presence. Aegis warns all pilots that they enter the Maelstroms at their own risk, and should prepare for combat situations.”\n“All of the eight systems containing Maelstroms are still affected by the same anti-Guardian field that was first witnessed in HIP 22460. Therefore, weapons based on Guardian technology will not function and should be replaced with other anti-xeno armaments.”","extractionDate":"2023-06-23T20:13:32Z","deprecated":false}
