For example, ‘the Wisanye system’ rolls off the tongue much more agreeably than ‘the Witch Head Sector FB-X c1-7 system’.”\n“We are confident that these more personable memorable terms will be welcomed by the Witch Head community.”\nThe Witch Head enclave is currently experiencing a number of Thargoid incursions, prompting local factions to call for assistance.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:19:39Z","deprecated":false}
