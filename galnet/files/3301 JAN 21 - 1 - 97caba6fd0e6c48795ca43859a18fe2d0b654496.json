Chancellor Anders Blaine made an announcement on the steps of the Imperial Palace saying -\n“It is with deep regret I have to announce that his Grace, the Emperor Hengist Duval, remains too unwell to participate in the wedding ceremony tomorrow. As such, it is with great sadness that I must declare a temporary postponement of the intended revelries. Hopefully this will be a delay of just a few days. I will make announcements each day once we know more.”\nThe Chancellor refused to take questions, and returned inside the palace moments after his announcement.\nAlthough there is anger amongst some lesser dignitaries that they weren’t told in advance, the markets did not notably change in reaction to this news, suggesting that the true state of the Emperor’s health has come as no surprise to those in power.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:47:20Z","deprecated":false}
