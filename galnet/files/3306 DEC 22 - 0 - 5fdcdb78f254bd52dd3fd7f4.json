The majority vote was in favour of this resolution.\nNew appointees to the board have already stated that the rejected bid by Federal shipbuilder Core Dynamics will be reappraised. Jupiter Rochester, the corporation’s CEO, has welcomed the opportunity for fresh discussions.\nChairperson Naomi Landseer, who is one of the directors being replaced, told Vox Galactica:\n“It’s no coincidence that the board members being voted out are the same ones who were against Core Dynamics owning the company. I am convinced that Rochester’s people are bribing or threatening our shareholders to make sure this hostile takeover goes through.”\nLakon Spaceways is currently offering a 30% discount on sales of Asp Scouts, Diamondback Scouts, Keelbacks, Type-7 Transporters and Type-10 Defenders.\nCore Dynamics has applied a 30% markdown to sales of the Eagle MkII and the Vulture, with a 20% discount for Federal Assault Ships, Federal Dropships and Federal Gunships.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:08:22Z","deprecated":false}
