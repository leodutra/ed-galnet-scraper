Independent correspondents, reporting from Mu Koji, have confirmed that the Empire lost considerably more ships than the Federation.\nIn the wake of the victory, a spokesperson for Xuangu Crimson Major Network thanked those who supported the campaign. Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Aksyonov Hub in Mu Koji.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:48:07Z","deprecated":false}
