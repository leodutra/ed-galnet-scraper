The station will initially be housed in New Yembo, a resource rich system on the outer edges of human-occupied space.\nThousands of Commanders helped provide the materials necessary to build this new state of the art Ocellus. The actual construction of the station took tens of thousands of workers just three weeks to complete, which in itself is a testament to the highly organised and methodical approach that the EAUC collaboration has applied to this project.\nGalNet can also now exclusively reveal that after an impassioned round of debates between EA and UC committee members, the New Yembo starport has been given the name Unity in honour of the collaborative effort that made its creation possible.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:52:29Z","deprecated":false}
