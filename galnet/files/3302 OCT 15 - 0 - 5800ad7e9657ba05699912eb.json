Expansion is costly, so when a faction expands, the wealth and development level of the system it controls are temporarily reduced.\nHere are the latest factions in withdrawal:\nUrd Confederation\nLatugara Society\nNurundere Labour\nUalangur Gold Comms Corp.\nJolagro Dragons\t\nMovement for LHS 28 for Equality\nRoss 1003 Prison Colony\nPacalite Universal Systems\nCD-47 990 Company\nUmbrogo Partnership\nFactions are considered to be in withdrawal if their level of influence within a system drops below a certain level. If the faction's influence remains low for a total of five days, the faction must leave the system entirely. If the faction manages to increase its level of influence, it remains in the system."}
