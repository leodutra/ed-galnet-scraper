Many of these stations remain in a critical state, and are unable to offer essential services.\nIn response, Federal President Zachary Hudson and Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval have issued fresh appeals for aid, imploring independent pilots to support relief efforts.\nIn her announcement, Arissa Lavigny-Duval said:\n“Relief coordinators are doing everything they can, but without the support of the galactic community, the restoration of these stations will take a long time. I therefore implore independent pilots to deliver essential commodities to the affected starports, and to evacuate civilians.”\nThe Emperor also confirmed that Aegis is investigating reports that the Thargoids are moving towards the core systems.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:44:15Z","deprecated":false}
