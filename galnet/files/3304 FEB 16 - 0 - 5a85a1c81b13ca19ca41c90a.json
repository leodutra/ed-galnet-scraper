The commodities will be used to perform essential maintenance on the Sim-Archive, a repository of digitised memories.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Pranav Antal released the following statement:\n“Our thanks go to those who supported this campaign, which will help us safeguard the Sim-Archive for at least another century. But while the Archive is of singular importance, it does not represent the limit of our ambitions. It is my hope that we might one day be able to digitise the human consciousness, thereby transcending our physical selves.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Chargaff Orbital in the Airman Di system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:34:47Z","deprecated":false}
