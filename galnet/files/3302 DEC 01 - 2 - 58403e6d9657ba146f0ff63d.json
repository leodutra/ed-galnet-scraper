I just couldn't see how we'd get the goods in time. But then a ship docked at Vancouver Ring, groaning under the weight of its cargo. And then another, and another.\"\n\"To the pilots who came to our aid, I just want to say â€“ you saved my life!\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Vancouver Ring in the Tchernobog system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:59:26Z","deprecated":false}
