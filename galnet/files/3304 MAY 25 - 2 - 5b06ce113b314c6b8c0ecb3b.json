To quote Plato: ‘Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything’.”\nIn support of the event, Los Chupacabras have placed an open order for quantities of beer, tobacco, coffee and narcotics, and have promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Meredith City in the LFT 926 system.\nThe campaign begins on the 24th of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
