The summary stated:\n“Nanomedicine is a carefully regulated branch of medical science, with little scope for public application, but Vitadyne’s nanomeds are more sophisticated and reliable than any existing product. Furthermore, Vitadyne’s data regarding healing, disease treatment and extension of longevity has been verified.”\n“Having confirmed the product’s effectiveness, IHO teams are now conducting independent tests with patients.”\nMedia outlet Vox Galactica published this viewpoint from healthcare analyst Dr Himari Grey:\n“The pharmaceutical industry is astonished that a small company like Vitadyne could produce something so advanced. Professor Katrien Rook’s credentials are impeccable, of course, but this is a work of genius. These nanomeds could be the most exciting thing in medicine for decades.”"}
