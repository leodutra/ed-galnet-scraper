These include Titan's Daughter in the Taygeta system, Liman Legacy in HIP 16753 and the Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55.” \n“In conjunction with local security services and system authorities, we are increasing defensive measures at all starports where Aegis has a presence.”\nProfessor Alba Tesreau, the organisation’s chief scientific advisor, voiced additional concerns:\n“Aegis research centres were set up to increase our understanding of the Thargoids, so it’s clear they’re attempting to prevent us investigating their technology and artefacts. Naturally we’ll take precautions, but I can only wonder what a long-term solution might be. Will we have to establish laboratories in secret locations, such as bunkers or asteroids? Aegis’s work is critical – only through knowledge might we establish a real relationship with this species.”"}
