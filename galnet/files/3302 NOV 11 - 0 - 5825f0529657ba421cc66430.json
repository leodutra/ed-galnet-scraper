The news comes less than 24 hours after the criminal organisation launched an operation to push the PRE out of Maia.\nIt is understood the Ant Hill Mob leveraged its connections in Maia's criminal network to achieve its aims in a remarkably short amount of time.\nBut the Pleiades Resource Enterprise is not out of the fight yet. The organisation has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in Maia and the surrounding systems, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Obsidian Orbital.\nThe campaign will run from the 11th to the 17th of November 3302. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:51:28Z","deprecated":false}
