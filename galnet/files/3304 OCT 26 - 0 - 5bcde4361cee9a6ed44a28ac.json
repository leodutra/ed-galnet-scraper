This will free up council members, allowing them to govern more effectively. The presidential term has also been extended to three years.”\nPresident Kincaid told the media:\n“I regret that the Assembly cannot see how the Alliance would be strengthened by an empowered president, but I must respect their decision, and promise to put my new team of emissaries to good use.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:07:33Z","deprecated":false}
