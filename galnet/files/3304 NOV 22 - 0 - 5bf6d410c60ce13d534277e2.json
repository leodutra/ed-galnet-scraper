After the New Loha Party claimed this was a false flag operation designed to discredit them, diplomacy was rapidly replaced by weapons fire.”\n“Since neither side has an extensive fleet, both Loha Holdings and the New Loha Party have appealed for support. I’ve received word that they’re offering substantial rewards to independent combat pilots who can aid them in this conflict.”\nThe two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 22nd of November 3304.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:10:43Z","deprecated":false}
