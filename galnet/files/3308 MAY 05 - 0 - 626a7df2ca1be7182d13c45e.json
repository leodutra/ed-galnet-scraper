These were then redirected to Didio and distributed wherever they were most urgently needed.\nThe campaign was orchestrated by Admiral Nikolas Glass, who announced:\n“By replenishing key supplies during this time of great crisis, Sirius Corporation has again shown its dedication to the Alliance’s military efforts. This will undoubtedly pave the way for the strategic defence pact to be accepted by the Assembly once the trial period has completed.” \nSirius Corporation has confirmed that all pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect payment from Chariot of Rhea in Leesti.\nIn related news, the superpowers are continuing to reward independent ships for destroying Thargoid vessels in the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems. Salvation’s anti-xeno superweapons are expected to be operational one week from today.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:22:23Z","deprecated":false}
