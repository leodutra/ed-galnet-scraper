Someone who understands the hardships faced by many Imperial citizens.”\n“As Hadrian Jansen, I was a poor child with no family other than my father. Together we scraped a living as independent traders. He never spoke of his past – not even when he died two years ago. That was when I inherited his ship and became a Commander myself.”\n“When Imperator Mordanticus informed me of my heritage, I knew I had to accept my identity as a Duval. I’ve seen how diminished the Empire has become, and I know that new leadership is sorely needed.”\n“I ask you to honour the legacy of the Duval bloodline. With Nova Imperium, let’s save the Empire we love.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:52:28Z","deprecated":false}
