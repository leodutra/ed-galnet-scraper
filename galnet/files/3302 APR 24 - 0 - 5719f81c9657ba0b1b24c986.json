The system has become a hub for explorers contributing to the Sagittarius-Carina Mission, a project to chart the Sagittarius-Carina Arm from its root at the galactic core to its tip at the galactic rim.\nOrganised by the First Great Expedition, the mission is open to all pilots â€“ the only requirement being that they own a ship and can dare to dream.\n\"We have a strong support network, an amazing list of places to visit, and vast regions of uncharted territory to explore. What we don't have is a schedule. Anyone can jump in any time, at any stage of the journey,\" said one member of the FGE.\nCommander Corbin Moran","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:06:06Z","deprecated":false}
