Consequently, Mould Federal Mining Incorporated has volunteered to finance an emergency initiative that will supply the required resources.\nA spokesperson for the company issued the following statement:\n“This will be a party like no other, where people can come together to celebrate life, love and beer. We are honoured to play our part in supporting a festival such as this. Nothing is more important to us than helping our communities.”\nMould Federal Mining Incorporated has placed an open order for animal meat, fish and beer, promising to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Leavitt Port in the Bhagui system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those contributing to the initiative can do so safely.\nThe campaign begins on the 27th of September 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
