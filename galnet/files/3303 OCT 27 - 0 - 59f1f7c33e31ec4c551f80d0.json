A range of traditional activities has been planned, including a game known as apple bobbing, although purists have been quick to point out that, \"suspending oneself upside down in a vat of Leestian Evil Juice is most definitely not apple bobbing\".\nTo ensure the event is a success, the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 has placed an open order for a range of commodities, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these goods to Patterson Vision in the LHS 2094 system.\nA spokesperson for the Hallowed Chapter of LHS 2094 elaborated on the nature of the event:\n\"There's a risk the festivities could be overshadowed by this whole Thargoid thing, but just because there are hostile aliens in Maia doesn't mean we can't have fun. I mean, the Thargoids are all the way out there...and the party is happening right here!\"\nThe campaign begins on the 26th of October 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:02:12Z","deprecated":false}
