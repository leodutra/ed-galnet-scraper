Its objective will be to find ways to open communication with the Thargoids and make peaceful overtures to end the conflict.\nPolly  French, organiser of a Thargoid Advocacy Project rally in Andavandul, told the media:\n“War with the Thargoids represents multiple failures. A failure to imagine coexistence with another intelligent species. A failure to restrain our violent reactions to the unknown. By sending emissaries and opening diplomatic channels, we can prove that human civilisation is advanced enough to seek peace.”\n“I am grateful to Governor Chase for his generous funding and promotion of this project. Sincere thanks are also due to all the pilots who transported computer components, semiconductors and titanium, as well as those who fought hard to defend this operation. Personally, I’m very excited to see our new vessel for the first time.”\nDeutsche Elite Piloten Interstellar is now offering payment and combat bond reimbursement to all contributors from Blenkinsop Hub in the Andavandul system.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:16:56Z","deprecated":false}
