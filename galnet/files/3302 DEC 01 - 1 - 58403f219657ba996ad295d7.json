A competing initiative from the Federation proved less popular with the galactic community.\nIn a brief statement, the spokesperson thanked those who had contributed to the initiative, and continued to say:\n\"We know there are secrets buried in this data. We only hope we can unlock them in time.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Sereborv Terminal in the HR 6421 system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:59:26Z","deprecated":false}
