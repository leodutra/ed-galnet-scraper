Had I known that Arissa intended to carry out such a brutal purge of his followers, my approach would have been different.”\n“Although he has been labelled an enemy of the Empire, I found myself unable to ignore this new member of the Duval family, and so requested a meeting in the Paresa system.”\n“Another reason to make contact was to verify his claim to be Emperor Hengist's grandson. All the genetic tests were conclusive – Hadrian is indeed my cousin by blood.”\n“We have now opened a dialogue to see if there can ever be common ground between us. Perhaps together we can heal divisions within the Empire.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:01:43Z","deprecated":false}
