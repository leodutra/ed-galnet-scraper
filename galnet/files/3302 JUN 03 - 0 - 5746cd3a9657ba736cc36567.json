After more than a year of work, the Canonn has become one of the most open, diligent and dedicated science organisations in inhabited space, and now we have an amazing research centre.\"\n\"I want to thank those who supported the construction of the institute. I'm looking forward to repaying that faith by sharing the discoveries we make here!\"\nDr Arcanonn finished by announcing an open order for UAs and meta-alloys to help initiate research at the institute.\nCommander Lord Zoltan","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:51:53Z","deprecated":false}
