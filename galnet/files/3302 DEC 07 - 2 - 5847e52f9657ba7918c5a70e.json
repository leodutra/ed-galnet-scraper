Identifying themselves as members of a religious order called the Apocolyptican Faith, the protesters claim the crash site is sacred to their faith and should be protected by law. A spokesperson for the organisation said it would continue to protest at Buckyball events until the club issued a formal apology.\nPrimus Timothy Dalen, a representative of the organisation, said:\n\"We are very disappointed with Buckyball Racing Club for treating the cultural and religious practices of others so lightly. We are working towards having these sites protected by local and territorial law, and hope to have something in place by the end of the year.\"\nCommander Vandal Stormovik","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:18:58Z","deprecated":false}
