So I have decided to fund a commodity drive to get Supratech back on its feet.”\n“I have invited the People's Rakapila Progressive Party to organise shipments of Computer components, Auto-fabricators and Hardware diagnostic sensors, which will enable Supratech to resume its innovative work.”\nDeliveries should be made to Stone Enterprise in the Rakapila system. To protect traders, the People's Rakapila Progressive Party has placed a kill order on all wanted ships in the system.\nThe initiative begins on the 31st of January 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
