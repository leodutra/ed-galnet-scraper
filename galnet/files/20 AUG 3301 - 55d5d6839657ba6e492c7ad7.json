Each of these is to be delivered to a specific starport, as outlined below:\nBattle Weapons should be taken to Saarinen Station in the Kamcha system\nCeremonial Heike Tea should be taken to Sikorsky Orbital in the Jang Di system\nToxic Waste should be taken to Blaauw Port in the Dinkas system\nLittle is known about Emperor’s Dawn, but it seems that the curiously-named organisation, which is based in the Kamcha system, has access to considerable resources, as it is throwing a lot of money at this commercial endeavour. Pilots of a mercantile disposition would do well to consider participating in this effort, as there is certainly an opportunity for resourceful traders to make a tidy profit."}
