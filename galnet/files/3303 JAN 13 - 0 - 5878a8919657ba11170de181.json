We cannot rule out the possibility that these ships could be experimental human spacecraft, or even the product of an intricate hoax. I urge all Imperial citizens to remain calm, and not to leap to conclusions.\"\nFederal President Zachary Hudson, meanwhile, struck a characteristically strident tone:\n\"I have reviewed the footage submitted by the galactic community. Granted, the evidence is not conclusive. But tell me this: would you rather prepare for an attack that may not come, or be met by an attack you did not prepare for? We know nothing about the true nature or purpose of these vessels. It would be in our best interest to prepare for any eventuality.\"\nBy contrast, Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon was diplomatic:\n\"Like the Emperor, I believe it would be premature to conclude that these are non-human spacecraft. But it is clear to me that these encounters warrant further investigation. We must gather more evidence and keep an open mind. Knowledge, not ignorance. Proof, not speculation. That is the way forward.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:33:05Z","deprecated":false}
