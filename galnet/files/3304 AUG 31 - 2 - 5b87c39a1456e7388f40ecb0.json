She is now campaigning to be elected to Congress as an independent candidate.\nAt a rally protesting against the Far God sect, Mrs Bishop addressed the crowd:\n“I may lack political experience, but I care about protecting decent families from alien-loving deviants. If you elect me to Congress, I will make sure our leaders rid us of the Thargoid spies undermining our great Federation!”\nDr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune made this response:\n“Juanita Bishop is building her powerbase on the fear and paranoia that she herself has invoked. As has happened before, an innocent religion is being used as a scapegoat for society’s ills.”\n“We should be more concerned about the fact that Far God chapters are continuing to vanish without trace. If they are under threat, it is our duty to offer protection. These people are not aliens but citizens with legal rights, despite Bishop’s efforts to dehumanise them.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:46:34Z","deprecated":false}
