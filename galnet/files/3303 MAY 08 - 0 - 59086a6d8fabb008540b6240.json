When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction’s influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nCoalition of Ngaliba\nLeague of Orishpucho Movement\nLopocareni United\nValues Party of Orishpucho\nOrishpucho Crimson Legal Int\nLibanatya Gold Netcoms Comms\nSocial HIP 86063 Free\nAristocrats of G 239-25\nLidpar Blue Hand Gang\nConfederacy of Hyperion\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction’s influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending."}
