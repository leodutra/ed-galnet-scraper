Dozens of cartel members were killed in combat and thousands more arrested, while vast amounts of illegal substances were seized.”\nThe narcotics kingpin Oberon Church spent decades establishing his empire, but with such catastrophic losses it has been virtually dismantled. Members of Federal Congress have congratulated the FIA for ‘removing this blight on Federal society’.\nExecutive Agent Viola Trask suggested that “this success was only possible due to the detailed information volunteered by Jan Sandoval, one of the Red Family’s founders.” It is widely assumed that Church’s arrest will follow soon, effectively eliminating the cartel."}
