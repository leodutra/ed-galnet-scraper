One member of the commune said:\n\"We are surrounded by a galactic mystery. Recent events indicate that humanity may not be alone in the universe.\"\n\"Some believe we are being stalked by monsters. Others think we will soon encounter a higher intelligence. We must be optimistic, and meet the future – whatever it may hold – with a collective voice.\"\n\"I believe humanity is being watched, its actions noted. Soon, we will be judged. Our survival depends on the decisions we make right now. We must not, and cannot, fight among ourselves.\"\nCommander Gan\nUtopian News Network | Interstellar Press"}
