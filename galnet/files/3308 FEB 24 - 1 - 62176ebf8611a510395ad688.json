Colonel Ronan Brock, the mercenaries’ leader, was killed during the fighting when he fled from the Onyx Storm megaship and was shot down by Imperial auxiliaries.\nEmperor Arissa praised all those who helped destroy Darkwater, and declared: “Let the Battle of Summerland mark the victorious end of our bitter war against both the NMLA and the traitors who sought to destabilise the Empire.”\nACT clarified that “Although there may always be Neo-Marlinist extremists, the large-scale threat of the NMLA has finally been nullified.” All data obtained from the terrorists’ Omega Grid network has now been shared with the relevant security agencies.\nWith Darkwater eliminated, the Empire has installed a new controlling faction into the Summerland system. The Praetorian Vigil will report directly to the Emperor and govern in her name.\nThe Summerland Patron’s Party will redeem combat bonds and provide other rewards at the starport Henry O’Hare’s Hangar. A permit exemption allowing all independent pilots to enter the Summerland system will remain active for the next two weeks.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:24:25Z","deprecated":false}
