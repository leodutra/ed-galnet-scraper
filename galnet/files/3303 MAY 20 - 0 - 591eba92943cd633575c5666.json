Furthermore, several observers claim to have seen the so-called unknown ships at the wreckage sites. Attempts to intercept the ships were unsuccessful.\nChief of Federal Security Admiral Aden Tanner, who is understood to be investigating the mysterious ships, addressed the reports:\n“These claims are certainly troubling, but I would remind you their veracity has not yet been verified, and I would urge the public to remain calm. Rest assured that we are investigating the matter.”"}
