I see this as a hugely positive step that will prevent further conflict.”\n“In essence, the NMLA is offering reparations for the unfortunate casualties of its anti-authority activities within the Empire. In return, it requests a permanent presence in the Imperial Senate as a means of continuing political dialogue.”\nMany other parliamentarians considered the proposal to be highly controversial. Minister Octavia Volkov declared:\n“Providing the NMLA with a political wing, pretending they are reasonable people, suggesting they could pay off the families of everyone they’ve murdered… Whyte, you are an insult not just to Marlinism but to all humanity!”\nFirst Minister Jenna Fairfax called for unity, insisting that the Marlinist Colonies must stand together to ensure their survival. However, she has officially requested that the Marlinism Reformation Party reverses its stance on negotiating with the NMLA.","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:45:58Z","deprecated":false}
