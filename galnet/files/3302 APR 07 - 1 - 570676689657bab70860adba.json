The system's inhabitants have taken to the streets to express their displeasure with local authorities, which have been criticised for failing to tackle rampant criminal activity.\nIn response to this development, the Morrina Pro-Alliance Party has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Barjavel Vision.\nThe campaign begins on the 7th of April 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
