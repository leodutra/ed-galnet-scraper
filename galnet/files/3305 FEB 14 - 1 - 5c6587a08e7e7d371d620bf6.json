To reassure the public, Atlas is investing in improved defences for the Merope system.”\n“Traders are invited to deliver Reactive Armour and Military Grade Fabrics to Reed's Rest. To help protect incoming ships from criminal elements, we have also allocated bounties to all wanted vessels in the system.”\nThe initiative begins on the 14th of February 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:12:55Z","deprecated":false}
