It won’t be long before the space lanes of Geras are littered with the burned-out shells of dead ships.”\nThe warring organisations have issued calls to independent combat pilots for support. Commanders who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction.\nBoth factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 1st of November 3304.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:04:47Z","deprecated":false}
