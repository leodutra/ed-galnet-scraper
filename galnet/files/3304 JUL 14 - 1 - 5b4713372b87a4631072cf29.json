The Grand Lottery also funds a wide range of social and infrastructure projects in Federation systems.\nThe annual Galactic Jackpot is by far the most popular lottery game, but on this occasion the winner has yet to make a claim. Purchase of the winning ticket has been confirmed, but no data is available as to who bought the ticket or when.\nTori Theopolis, a spokesperson for the Federal Grand Lottery, told the media:\n“Someone out there is rich beyond his or her wildest dreams – they just don’t know it yet. We’re keen to find this lucky individual so we can hand over their winnings. We ask all citizens to check with any lottery players they know. Your soon-to-be-billionaire friend or relative might be very grateful for your help!”"}
