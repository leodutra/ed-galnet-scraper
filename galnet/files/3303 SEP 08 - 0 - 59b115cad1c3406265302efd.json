But as talk of a truce gains ground, anonymous sources have reported that influential Imperials have questioned the wisdom of withdrawing from the Pleiades.\nDaxton Sung of the Imperial Herald said:\n“Can the Federation be trusted? That’s the question the Empire is asking. Assuming both sides agree to withdraw, the Empire is worried that the Federation will renege on the deal. But such heel-dragging is to be expected. The fact is that there’s a real desire, on both sides of the fence, to end this ridiculous conflict.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:08:04Z","deprecated":false}
