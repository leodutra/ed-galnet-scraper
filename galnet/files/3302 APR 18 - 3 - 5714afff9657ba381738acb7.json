When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nLP 104-2 Silver State Comms\nPaucates Gold Brothers\nKaiablingah Blue Raiders\nGrovichun Purple Boys\nUnited Epsilon Indi Flag\nLTT 8517 Jet Gang\nIrukama Labour\nNatural Vega Liberty Party\nGridge Life Exchange\nMaiki Silver Mafia\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending."}
