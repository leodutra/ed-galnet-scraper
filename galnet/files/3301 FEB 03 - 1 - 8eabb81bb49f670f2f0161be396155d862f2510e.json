The former is Federation-aligned and unsurprisingly calls the nearby HIP 43760 home, while the latter is a local firm. \nObservers have reported a heavy handed response to this Federal involvement in an Imperial system, resulting in the Imperial Navy setting up checkpoints near a number of local planets. One source, who asked to remain unnamed, said \"these checkpoints are manned by Elite Vipers and Cobras fitted with Plasma Accelerators, and so not to be taken lightly.\" \nBattles have broken out across the system, with various local factions offering combat bonds in an attempt to urge independent pilots to lend a hand in the small scale factional struggle."}
