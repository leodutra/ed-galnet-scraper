We are deeply grateful to all pilots who took part.”\nVistaenis Incorporated, Saud Kruger’s partner in this initiative, is now offering payment for the exploration data at Youll Port in the Vistaenis system. \nTourist beacons will be added to the most suitable systems by Thursday the 28th of October, which will record for posterity the names of the pilots who submitted the most compelling images.\nAs a result of the initiative, a discount of 15% will be applied to sales of all Dolphin, Orca and Beluga Liner ships from the 1st of October, alongside a reduction in cost for the luxury-class cabins which can be installed in any of Saud Kruger’s vessels.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:22:56Z","deprecated":false}
