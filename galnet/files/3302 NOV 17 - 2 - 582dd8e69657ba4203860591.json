The battle, instigated by the Ant Hill Mob, was designed to weaken the Enterprise's position in Maia.\nHundreds of independent pilots supported the campaign by targeting Pleiades Resource Enterprise fighters and delivering battle weapons to system security forces. But ultimately it was not enough to defeat the PRE.\nA spokesperson for the Pleiades Resource Enterprise released a brief statement:\n\"Clearly, the galactic community supports our position in Maia. The Ant Hill Mob needs to accept that the Pleiades Resource Enterprise is here to stay. We're not going anywhere.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:23:34Z","deprecated":false}
