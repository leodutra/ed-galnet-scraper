Furthermore, decrypted information has revealed the location of League strongholds in two separate systems, one in Imperial and one in Federal space.”\n“We are determined to eliminate these terrorists before they can wreak any more havoc, but fully expect tough resistance. Therefore we ask the galactic community to provide support in wiping out these dangerous extremists.”\nThe operation in Zibal will be coordinated by Zibal Power Co. Likewise, military action in Ienpalang will be supported by Ienpalang Corporation.\nThe campaign begins on the 19th of July 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:55:00Z","deprecated":false}
