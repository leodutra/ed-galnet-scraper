Members of the group contaminated the EX7 fertiliser with a synthetic agent designed to putrefy plant matter.” \nRecent efforts by the galactic community have almost eradicated the EX7 fertiliser. But Borstein warned that the activists have turned hostile upon discovery.\n“The group’s manifesto discusses revenge for the Federation’s 3301 campaign to wipe out the recreational drug known as Onion Head. This involved an orbital bombardment of Onion Head crops on Panem using biocides with a similar genomic structure to the blight. It’s likely that the activists used these biocides as the foundation of their synthetic agent.”\n“Shortly after we located Scythe of Panem cells in the Quator system, their more militant members responded with unprovoked violence. Local citizens are now at risk of being caught in the crossfire.”\nAn effort to neutralise the activists is being led by the Bruthanvan Co faction, which has requested tactical support from the galactic community.\nIndependent pilots who destroy Scythe of Panem ships in the Quator system will be generously rewarded by Bruthanvan Co. This campaign will run from the 22nd to the 28th of October 3305.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:09:27Z","deprecated":false}
