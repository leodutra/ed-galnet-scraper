My focus as president will be on attracting more independent systems to our interstellar family.”\nHe was followed by the current incumbent, President Gibson Kincaid: \n“Fazia Silva’s assassination was an assault on our democracy. The Alliance’s enemies are growing bold, and we must do the same. I beseech the Assembly to imbue the presidential role with executive powers, to transform our Alliance into a true superpower capable of challenging its adversaries.”\nPrime Minister Edmund Mahon thanked both candidates and wished them good luck in the election.\nThe public vote will take place on Tuesday the 16th of October and the results will be announced later that week.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:22:50Z","deprecated":false}
