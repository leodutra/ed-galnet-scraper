A mystery object has been placed somewhere in space, and the first person to find it and deliver it to a specified location will win the competition. Jeffress has released a riddle that he claims will set participants on the path to finding the mystery object:\n\"The king's resting place is where I'm hid. Entrusted to a queen, with a spring in her steps.\"\nWith such a generous prize on offer, the event is sure to capture the imagination of the galactic community.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:57:41Z","deprecated":false}
