The Independent Commission for Market Equality has also reported irregularities in the recent transfer of share ownership, which may lead to criminal investigations.\nAs a result, although Lakon Spaceways continues to manufacture and sell ships, its lack of reserves and a loss of confidence among investors may lead to insolvency and dissolution.\nTrent Delaney, the newly appointed chairperson of Lakon’s board of directors, announced:\n“Financial mismanagement and a litany of poor business decisions have led to this situation. Rest assured that once formal negotiations with our new parent company are complete, Lakon’s stock will rise to new heights.”\nAccording to Federal business analysts, there are indications of displeasure among Core Dynamics senior directors regarding this takeover. An anonymous source from within the corporation told Vox Galactica:\n“The Lakon merger is entirely Jupiter Rochester’s project. Frankly, it’s sheer greed. Our income has soared recently with new commissions from the Navy, but Rochester’s grabbing hands are always reaching for something. He runs the departments that are loyal to him like they’re his personal kingdom.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:05:22Z","deprecated":false}
