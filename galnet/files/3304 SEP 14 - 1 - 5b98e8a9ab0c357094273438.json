While Hurd did not technically break the law, the FSS has kept a close eye on him ever since.”\nIn the wake of this news, a number of Herculean Machines’ corporate investors withdrew their support. Maddox Hurd told the media:\n“This is a smear campaign, and those underhanded snakes at Supratech are behind it!”\nScorpio DeVorrow, CEO of rival company Supratech, declined to comment, but Harlow Nassry, technology journalist at The Federal Times, observed:\n“With Herculean Machines losing investment and Supratech’s facility destroyed, both companies are in a compromised position. Unless they can drum up additional support, neither will be able to unveil their new designs at the Rackham Ultratech Expo in October.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:43:03Z","deprecated":false}
