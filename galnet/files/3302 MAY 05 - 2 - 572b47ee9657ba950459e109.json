Now, the organisation has issued an appeal to the galactic community for help in compiling an order of tantalum for an unnamed party.\nA spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement to the media:\n\"Ordinarily we would have no difficulty meeting an order of this kind, but given the relative urgency of the request, we have decided to place an open order for the necessary materials. Naturally we will generously reward those who lend us their support.\"\nThe spokesperson was asked to address rumours that the tantalum was in fact intended for a group of independent engineers, but she refused to be drawn on the subject:\n\"Our partners usually prefer to keep their identities private, since their transactions are often of a commercially sensitive nature. I'm sure you understand.\"\nThe Wyrd Raiders has promised to reward pilots who deliver tantalum to Gareth Edwards Park in the Wyrd system. The campaign begins on the 5th of May 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:20:21Z","deprecated":false}
