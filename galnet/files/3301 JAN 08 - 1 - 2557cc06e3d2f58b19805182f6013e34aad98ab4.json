I hate narcotics and think they should be made illegal. My mother died from them before I was old enough to remember her.”\nWhen asked about her father she replied -\n“Oh Serena. He was led astray in his youth, but Dad is a lovely man, and would make a great Emperor if his controlling father wasn’t so spiteful.”\nCommentators have expressed outrage at her comments about our beloved Emperor, and the network cut the broadcast at that point.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:58:22Z","deprecated":false}
