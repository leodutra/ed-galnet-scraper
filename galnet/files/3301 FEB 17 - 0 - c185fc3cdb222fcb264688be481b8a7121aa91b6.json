This team will be working around the clock to find a cure, but they canâ€™t do it alone.\nDr Miriam Fletcher, head of the Furbaide CDC, has requested that anyone shipping basic medicines divert to Effinger Port in order to donate the supplies needed to stop the Blight before it manages to spread any further."}
