His principal role regarding Starship One and Jupiter Division make him guilty of treason, mass murder and many other crimes. He will serve a solitary life sentence in a maximum security prison.”\nMilandu Okoro of the Federal Attorney’s Office expressed surprise:\n“It is highly unusual for the FJD not to litigate such a major case, considering we don’t know the full extent of Rochester and Fleet Admiral Vincent’s conspiracies. Unfortunately, our request to open a full investigation has been denied.”\nShadow Vice President Isolde Rochester has reiterated that her family were not involved with her eldest son’s clandestine activities.\nCore Dynamics is continuing to rebuild after several departments separated to form Jupiter Division. Owen McKenna, the new CEO, has vowed to purge the company of all his predecessor’s loyalists.\nDespite Rochester’s failure to build a powerbase in the HIP 54530 system, his manifesto of placing the Federation under direct corporate rule has received praise in some regions. A corporatist movement, founded by commercial networks and civil groups, is gradually gaining popularity.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:04:01Z","deprecated":false}
