It was only available for a brief period in October 3306, but can now be purchased from any human technology broker.\nFreshly mined bromellite, lithium hydroxide, osmium and samarium were delivered by a large number of pilots. Due to the volume of shipments received, the initial amount of materials required by customers to purchase the weapon has been temporarily reduced.\nLiz Ryder made this statement from her Demolition Unlimited workshop:\n“Thank you to everyone who helped launch – so to speak – this module onto the market. I hope that engineers and tech brokers can continue working together on providing more options to the galactic community.”\nPilots who delivered commodities for this initiative can now collect their rewards from Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:53:05Z","deprecated":false}
