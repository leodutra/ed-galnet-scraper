We are therefore calling on all Federation-aligned pilots to deliver insulating membrane, gallium and power generators to our base of operations at Ramsbottom Hub, so we can start work on the first outpost.\"\nThe initiative begins on the 7th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
