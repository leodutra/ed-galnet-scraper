When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nKamadhenu Partners\nDrug Empire of HIP 78866\nTaexaliTemu Empire Group\nWorker's Party of Kemurukamar\nNationals of Seurbi\nFreedom Party of Kala\nThosiao Republic Party\nHIP 60953 Jet Clan\nWolf 906 Gold Ring\nMonarchy of GCRV 54903\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending."}
