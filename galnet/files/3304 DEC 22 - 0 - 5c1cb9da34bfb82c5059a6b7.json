In all cases, the nanomedicines eliminated malignant cells, boosted immune systems and repaired damaged tissue.”\n“There is no doubt that this product represents a breakthrough in nanomedicine, with enormous healthcare potential.”\nProfessor Katrien Rook, owner of Vitadyne Labs, told the media:\n“It’s highly gratifying to have our work validated in this way. I’m grateful to the IHO for its diligence, and I look forward to introducing our nanomedicines to the galaxy.”"}
