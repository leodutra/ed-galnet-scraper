The starport Miner Prospects has now opened for business in the planetary ring of LP 339-7 4.\nCompany CEO Dr Lewis Chapman held a press conference to thank those involved:\n“The new base will offer much-needed resources to the system’s outer reaches, and act as the headquarters for our SE Mining division. I never doubted the galactic community’s response, and it is a humbling thing to see in action.”\nCommanders who contributed to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Gell-Mann Ring in the LP 339-7 system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:22:56Z","deprecated":false}
