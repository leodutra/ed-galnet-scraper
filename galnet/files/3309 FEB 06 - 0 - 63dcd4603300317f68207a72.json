The Assembly has re-appraised a bill proposed last November by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran, seeking to approve Aegis’s reformation. A majority vote has now passed that bill.”\n“The Alliance will therefore commit ships, resources and personnel to a collaborative anti-xeno agency. We will also share Thargoid-related intelligence and scientific data to a central database shared with the Empire and Federation.”\n“The strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation remains in effect, and the company continues to work with us on protecting Allied systems.”\nIt has been suggested that Li Yong-Rui privately advised the prime minister against holding the vote, with the view that Sirius Corporation could fill the role of humanity's primary anti-xeno organisation. However, political analysts noted that Mahon has a long-standing dedication to multilateral cooperation against the Thargoids.\nDeputy Prime Minister Corcoran will act as the Alliance’s primary contact with any new incarnation of Aegis. Commodore Emil Varga  has volunteered to serve as military liaison, with Dr Maximo Fonseca  of Gateway Laboratories taking the lead on xenological research.","extractionDate":"2023-02-27T19:54:38Z","deprecated":false}
