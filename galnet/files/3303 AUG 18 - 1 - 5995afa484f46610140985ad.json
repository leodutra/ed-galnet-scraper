Reports indicate that the agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.\nTo counter this threat, the Kuk Silver Fortune Company has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Vercors Station.\nThe campaign begins on 17th of August 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:20:31Z","deprecated":false}
