Kincaid was further reminded that a prior request for executive presidential powers had been unsuccessful, even if he insists on behaving otherwise.”\n“Although he still has supporters, a number of councillors have privately opined that Kincaid is now a toxic presence at odds with the Alliance’s ethos.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:18:03Z","deprecated":false}
