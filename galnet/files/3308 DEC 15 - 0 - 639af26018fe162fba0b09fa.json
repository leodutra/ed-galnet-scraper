Thanks to these focused efforts, the following weapons are now available for purchase:\nEnhanced AX Multi-cannon (Turreted)\nEnhanced AX Missile Rack (Turreted)\nEnhanced AX Multi-cannon (Fixed)\nThese modules are offered at all rescue megaships, which can be found using the Galaxy Map filter. Ships looking to engage Thargoid forces are advised to equip these weapons, particularly in Maelstrom systems where Guardian-based technology has proven ineffective.\nWork continues on the other enhanced weapons, based on designs by the engineers Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo which improve the original Aegis models. A further update will be provided next Thursday, unless no additional modules have been established during the week.","extractionDate":"2023-02-27T19:54:26Z","deprecated":false}
