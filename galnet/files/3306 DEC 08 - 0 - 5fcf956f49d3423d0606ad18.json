They can be processed as usual at any starport offering the relevant services.\nThis follows a turbulent period in many marketplaces that has impacted commodity prices, as well as producing a boost to the value of bounty vouchers.\nThe changes were remarked upon by Professor Ophelia Kaufmann, head of economics at Orion Independent University:\n“As anticipated, the ongoing volatility of financial markets has led to further widespread revaluation. With heightened hostility between the Empire and the Federation, coupled with terrorist attacks and a resurgence in Thargoid activity, it is hardly surprising that every faction now places a greater premium on protecting their citizens.”\n“Although some may view the current tranche of changes as inevitable or overdue, there may well be additional revaluing in other fields as a result of competing market forces. The only certainty is of further uncertainty.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:14:23Z","deprecated":false}
