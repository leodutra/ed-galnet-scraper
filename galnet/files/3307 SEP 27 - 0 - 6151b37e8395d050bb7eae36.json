But the ongoing mystery around the identity of this ‘man of science’, as well as his controversial methods, have led to a backlash.\"\n“To deliver vital components for his mysterious anti-xeno weapon, Salvation once again recruited independent pilots, directly messaging those who had performed tasks for him before. However, this time a counter-initiative was formed by those who did not trust his motivations. It was also supported by believers in non-aggression against the Thargoids, and others who feared that the weapon might endanger Cornsar’s population.”\n“Their actions involved acquiring the components, which were disguised as basic medicines, but destroying rather than delivering them. Whether or not this partial blockade impacted the weapon’s effectiveness remains unknown, but it acted as a substantial opposition to Salvation’s scheme.”\n“Aegis is investigating the Cornsar incident, but with faith in that organisation at an all-time low, individual Commanders are now taking matters into their own hands. Time will tell if Salvation’s ambition to replace Aegis is a noble goal, or if we are replacing the devil we know with a darker demon.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:27:10Z","deprecated":false}
