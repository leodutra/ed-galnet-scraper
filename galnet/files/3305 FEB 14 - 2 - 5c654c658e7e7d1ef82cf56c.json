Each of the works was replaced with the image of a winking cat.”\n“The loss of so many cultural artefacts is incalculable. This despicable criminal should have been hunted down long ago.”\nCulture journalist Kioko McGrath published an alternative view in The Federal Times:\n“High-profile crimes such as this have resulted in the ‘winking cat’ motif becoming a popular anti-establishment symbol, appearing in advertising, graffiti and music. Ironically, the calling card of an art thief is now itself a culturally significant work of art.”"}
