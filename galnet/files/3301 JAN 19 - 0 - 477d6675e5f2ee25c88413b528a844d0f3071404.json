He directed it at the Chancellor, Senator Blaine -\n“It saddens us to hear that his grace Emperor Hengist has fallen into a coma, but we need to think for the future of our beloved Empire. How long will his grace be in a coma before we trigger the succession? This has not happened in over a thousand years, and it is for us to decide. One day? One week? One month? One year? \n“We need a strong leader, and we should set a date in the near future when we review the situation.”\nThere was a frisson of mumbling in the Senate after his comments and a general consensus to review the situation at the next session."}
