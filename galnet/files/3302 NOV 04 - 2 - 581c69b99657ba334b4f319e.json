The Majestic-class Interdictor was heavily damaged in the altercation and was ignominiously forced to withdraw from the field of combat.\nAn organisation known as the Children of Raxxla has claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement, the organisation said it had been '\"backed into a corner\" after diplomatic entreaties regarding Kahina Loren – whom it referred to as Salomé – had gone unanswered. \nThe attack appears to have been a response to the 'guilty' verdict passed on Loren last week, and based on the assumption that she was aboard the INV Imperial Freedom. Vessels bearing Children of Raxxla markings were witnessed intercepting escape pods ejected from the beleaguered Interdictor.\nThe Children of Raxxla spokesperson said the group \"harboured no ill will towards Patreus\", and that \"the guilty parties continue to lurk in the shadows\".\nImperial security forces have condemned the attack, saying:\n\"This group has shown its true colours. Kahina Loren was known for inciting violence, and these terrorists are clearly intent on continuing her legacy.\"\nThe damage to the INV Imperial Freedom represents a blow to Admiral Patreus' ambitions to strengthen the Imperial fleet, exposing these battleships' vulnerability to attacks from well-organised independent forces.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:24:27Z","deprecated":false}
