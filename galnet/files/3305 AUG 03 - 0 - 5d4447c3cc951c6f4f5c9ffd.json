It portrays Alliance founders Mic Turner and Meredith Argent as rivals who faked their romance to rally political support.” \n“More traditionalist audiences – and not a few critics – took issue with the suggestion that the couple’s love was fraudulent, while others applauded it as bold and challenging. But this lively debate did nothing to dampen spirits at the event, which drew appreciative crowds.”\nThe Alliance Festival of Culture is scheduled to continue over the next five weeks."}
