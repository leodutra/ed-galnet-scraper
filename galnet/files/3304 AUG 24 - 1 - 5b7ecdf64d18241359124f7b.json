As much as we want to subdue this conflict ourselves, we simply do not have the ships to stage an effective intervention.”\nWith system security forces stretched thin, both organisations are seizing the opportunity to settle old grudges, and have issued calls for support. Pilots who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction.\nThe two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 23rd August 3304.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:38:30Z","deprecated":false}
