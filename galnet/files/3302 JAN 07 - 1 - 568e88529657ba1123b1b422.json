A member of the station's technical team released a brief statement to the media:\n\"The problems at the station have worsened over the past few weeks, but we're determined that Obsidian Orbital won't close. We're working around the clock, and burning through resources, but so far we haven't had to suspend any services.\"\nDespite this achievement, station personnel stressed they had not found a solution to the technological 'plague' blighting the galaxy, which continues to affect starports throughout inhabited space.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:38:53Z","deprecated":false}
