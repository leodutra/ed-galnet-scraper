Some commentators speculate that the rebel leaders are relying on intervention from independent pilots, although many consider this to be a foolish hope after the widespread support the Senator received in the Sorbago campaign. \nIndirect confirmation came from a comment in social media from a lowly shipyard loader driver, who posted that the ‘Cleopatra’ and the ‘Marlin’, two of Senator Torval’s Majestic Class Interdictors, were being provisioned to leave for the Ongkuma system.\nSenator Torval is still on her holiday cruise on the ‘Xanadu’ so was unavailable for comment.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:54:25Z","deprecated":false}
