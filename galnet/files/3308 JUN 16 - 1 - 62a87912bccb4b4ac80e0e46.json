Collecting and transporting these items can be a hazardous task, so I deeply appreciate the effort made by pilots to obtain them.”\n“It is becoming increasingly urgent to improve our understanding of the Thargoids’ biomechanical technology. There is no sign that hostilities are about to end, so the need to produce defences has become paramount. Only through ensuring our research focuses on up-to-date samples can we be sure that we are working as efficiently as possible.”\nContributors can now collect their rewards from Baird Gateway in the Arque system. This includes Grade 5 engineered Heavy Duty Hull Reinforcement Packages for eligible contributors.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:14:08Z","deprecated":false}
