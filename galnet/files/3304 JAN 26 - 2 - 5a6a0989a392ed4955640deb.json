Reports indicate that the agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.\nTo counter this threat, Angeli Imperial Enterprises has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Nelder City.\nThe campaign begins on the 25th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:42:06Z","deprecated":false}
