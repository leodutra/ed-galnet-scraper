I ask that you empower me to lead the Alliance into a new era of strength and unity. That is my vision.”\nAn increase in commerce is the focus for entrepreneur Fazia Silva:\n“The current president is driven entirely by ego, as are all career politicians, but it’s money that makes the galaxy go round. Only by investing in trade and industry can the Alliance truly grow.”\nCouncillor Elijah Beck has been critical of his rivals’ approach:\n“President Kincaid has little respect for our values, and Ms Silva wants to make it easier for her companies to increase profits. The Alliance deserves a president who puts the wellbeing of its people first, rather than their own selfish goals.”\nThe new president of the Alliance will be announced in October.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:00:21Z","deprecated":false}
