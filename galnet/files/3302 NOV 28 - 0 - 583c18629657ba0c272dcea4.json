When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nZaragas Energy Corp.\t\nHIP 111755 Gold Cartel\nHIP 118311 Posse\nLTT 537 Future\nDrug Empire of Caeresi\nVasho Mafia\nLambda-1 Tucanae Progressive Party\nVelnambang Rats\nSalibi Mafia\nRautandji Gold Partnership\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:35:50Z","deprecated":false}
