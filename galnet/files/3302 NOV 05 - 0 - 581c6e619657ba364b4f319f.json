So far, nearly 150 pilots have signed up.\nThe Earth Defense Fleet, the 9th Legion, the Iridium Wing, SEPP and the Prismatic Imperium have all pledged pilots to protect the freighters for the duration of the trip.\nDalilah William, a citizen of Colonia Hub, said:\n\"We need more of the essentials that those in the core systems take for granted, which is why we're calling on traders and haulers to join the Christmas Carriers Convoy, and appealing to combat pilots to protect them.\"\nSouvarine","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:24:36Z","deprecated":false}
