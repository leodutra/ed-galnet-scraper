This hastened long-term plans to abscond from Core Dynamics along with many ships and personnel. \nIn the permit-locked HIP 54530 system, the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group has been renamed as Jupiter Division. It is assumed to have long been infiltrated by Rochester’s loyalists.\nUsing the new self-appointed title of Supreme Executive Rochester, he broadcast this statement across all Federal media channels:\n“For many years, I helped Core Dynamics become one of the galaxy’s strongest companies, but petty laws and bureaucracy restricted me at every turn. I have always felt that people should not be ruled by politicians, but by those holding true economic power – the corporations.”\n“It will be a long time before I can act on my commercial plans, but I will prove that corporate rule is the most beneficial system of governance for the Federation.”\nJupiter Rochester is the eldest son of Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester, and a key member of the influential Rochester family. As yet there have been no public statements from his mother or siblings."}
