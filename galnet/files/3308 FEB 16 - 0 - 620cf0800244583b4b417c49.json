My trusted chancellor, senators and security agencies are to be commended.”\n“To those who dared to attack Imperial citizens, who dared to impersonate me and mislead my people…who took the lives of my family. Know this: there will be no place to hide from my wrath.”\n“And to all citizens who may fear these uncertain times, I vow that your Emperor will lead you into the glorious future that is ours by right.”\nSubsequent messages from the Imperial Palace praised ACT and its supporters for their work in freeing Arissa and destroying the NMLA. Princess Aisling Duval was also thanked for her dedication to finding out the truth, although some newsfeeds have noted that Aisling would hold a strong claim on a vacated throne.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:20:32Z","deprecated":false}
