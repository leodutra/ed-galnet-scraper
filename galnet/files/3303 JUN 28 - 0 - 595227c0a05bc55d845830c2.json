There is a clear visual relationship between the structures and the Thargoid vessels sighted in the Pleiades star cluster.\nEven more remarkable are reports that the structures encompass large subsurface complexes, accessed via the central edifice. Drone-like machines have also been seen roving the sites.\nProfessor Ishmael Palin, who played a central role in identifying the so-called Unknown Ships as Thargoid, commented on the discovery:\n“This is a remarkable development, and one that raises many questions. What is the purpose of these structures? Are there others out there? And what about the drones? Are they being controlled remotely, or are they autonomous?”\n“With each new discovery, we revise our perception of humanity and its place within the cosmos.”"}
