Aegis has mobilised available defences, but also requested assistance from anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots in combating the Thargoids.\nShipments of Guardian artefacts were recently delivered to the Delphi system as part of an Aegis research programme. Professor Alba Tesreau has speculated that the Thargoids’ well-documented aversion to Guardian technology may be the reason why Delphi was targeted.\nTwo starports recently constructed by the Kumo Crew syndicate – California Freeport in the HIP 18390 system and Fort Xeno in the HIP 62154 system – are among those seriously damaged by the assault. Archon Delaine, the syndicate’s warlord, announced:\n“I’m not going to let these filthy aliens tear down what we’ve only just built. We need to teach them a lesson that even they will understand!” \nAll attacked stations have called upon the galactic community for help with rescuing their populations.","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:46:18Z","deprecated":false}
