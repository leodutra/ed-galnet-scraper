The news came alongside the confirmation that the Pleiades Nebula barnacle sites have been exhausted, possibly due to over-exploitation by humanity. The galactic community has been asked to provide exploration data as part of the search.\nIn other news, The Federal Intelligence Agency has prevented an assassination attempt on Jan Sandoval within their own headquarters in Olympus Village. Sandoval, founder of the Red Family drug cartel, is currently in protective custody at the building after unexpectedly handing herself in to Federal agents. \nUnrest at Port Isabelle has continued to grow, following the forced emancipation of Imperial slaves by activist group Autonomy. Many of the freed individuals have besieged government buildings, demanding to be returned to slavery so they can fulfil their former contracts. \nAnd finally, a research megaship and relay station constructed by the Distant Worlds II exploratory fleet have become operational. The DSSV Distant Worlds is scheduled to follow a circular six-system route in the Galactic Centre region, while relay station Event Horizon will gather scientific data on Sagittarius A*.\nAnd those are the main stories this week.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:39:02Z","deprecated":false}
