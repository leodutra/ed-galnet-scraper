The FIA launched pre-emptive raids on these groups before they were able to strike against civilian targets.”\n“In addition, we have arrested several thousand individuals who were conducting research into terror tactics, radical ideologies and other suspicious subjects.”\n“The PDB will continue monitoring all comms networks, and liaising with local security agencies via the Federal Justice Department.”\nVice President Jerome Archer hailed these results as validation of the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, and stated that the PDB will help prevent the mass murder of Federal citizens.\nCivil rights groups have claimed that these extremists could have been detected via conventional policing methods, rather than intercepting personal messages. Independent criminologists added that the statistical likelihood of such amateur groups committing actual attacks is low.","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:47:43Z","deprecated":false}
