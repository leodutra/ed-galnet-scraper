Hardacre ordered the robot to stop, but it continued projecting data from its internal drives. Eventually he ran from the hall in panic.”\nLieutenant Inspector Ramesh Thorne of the Federal Security Service made this statement:\n“We have placed Mr Hardacre in custody while we verify multiple instances of fraud and misuse of company funds. We are also investigating how his personal admin robot managed to obtain such information, and why it chose to make the data public at this time.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:55:13Z","deprecated":false}
