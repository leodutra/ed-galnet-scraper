When a member of my household committed the most heinous of deeds, I submitted myself to the security services and gave them every access they needed.\n “We cannot wait to act, and I call upon the senate to commence an immediate and full investigation into any links between Princess Aisling and Emperor’s Dawn.”\nAfter the initial flurry of information from the Imperial Herald, no new facts were released today. Patron Damon Clarke remains at large, and the considered opinion is that he has fled the Empire.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:45:11Z","deprecated":false}
