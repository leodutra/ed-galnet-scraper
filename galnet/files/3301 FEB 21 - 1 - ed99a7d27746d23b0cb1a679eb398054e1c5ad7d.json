The exceptional sweetness of this honey has baffled scientists and foodologists for centuries, as the atmosphere on Slough itself is both toxic and highly acidic. The honey is made by the Vesperian “Orchid Bee”, an insect well known for its deadly sting. Vesperian beekeeping is a risky business, with numerous deaths occurring amongst keepers each year.\nCommander Angel Rose will be holding private auctions on behalf of SpecialEffects throughout the day.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:46:31Z","deprecated":false}
