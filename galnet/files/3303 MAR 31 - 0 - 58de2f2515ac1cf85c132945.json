This is a cold war, after all.\"\n\"Regardless of claims to the contrary, this conflict is about one thing: meta-alloys. Both sides want Maia and Merope because of the barnacles they contain, and both sides will keep pushing into those systems.\"\n\"Eventually, one of two things will happen: one side will withdraw...or neither side will. In the latter scenario, war seems inevitable.\"\nPoliticians on both sides of the divide have urged the superpowers to engage in amicable talks and establish some kind of agreement over the meta-alloys, but such entreaties have so far fallen on deaf ears.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:31:50Z","deprecated":false}
