Fortunately, United Meene Labour has graciously agreed to fund a comprehensive research project.\"\n\"I am therefore in the privileged position of being able to devote myself to studying data from the site. It is my hope that by decoding this data, we can learn more about the civilisation responsible for the ruins.\"\n\"Having conducted a preliminary survey of the site, I have determined that Pattern Delta Obelisk Data would of great value at this stage.\"\nUnited Meene Labour has promised to reward pilots who bring Pattern Delta Obelisk Data from the Synuefe ruins to Felice Dock in the Meene system. The campaign begins on the 3rd of November 3302 and will run for two weeks."}
