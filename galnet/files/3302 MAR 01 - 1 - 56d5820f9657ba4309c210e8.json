These are mainline warships â€“ the largest in the Federal Navy's inventory. That the president intends to make use of not one but two of these ships should seriously concern taxpayers.\"\n\"Is it necessary for the president to deploy a battle group every time he visits a foreign dignitary? What message does that send to other heads of state? It looks less like a matter of security and more like a show of force!\"\nCongresswoman Lasky announced that she will call upon the Federal Accountability Office to investigate the acquisition and deployment cost to the taxpayer, and put forward a measure to limit the president's use of the ships to a handful of occasions per fiscal year.\nCommander Driggers","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:39:53Z","deprecated":false}
