The attacks have resulted in significant damage and hundreds – possibly thousands – of deaths.\nGalactic authorities have confirmed that the affected starports are Titan's Daughter in the Taygeta system, Liman Legacy in HIP 16753, and the Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.\nIt is understood that the attacks were executed by a previously unseen class of Thargoid craft classified as an Interceptor Medusa. Footage from starport security feeds indicate that the Thargoid ships used their shutdown fields to neutralise station defences before targeting the main reactor. One eyewitness said, “It’s like they wanted to cripple us rather than destroy us outright.”\nAuthorities in the affected systems have responded with appeals for food, water, basic medicines and natural fabrics. They have also implored independent pilots to support relief operations by evacuating civilians from the starports.\nResponding to the development, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval said:\n“Our thoughts are with those affected by these attacks. While I have every confidence that system authorities will be able to address the situation, the Empire is ready to help if necessary.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:03:43Z","deprecated":false}
