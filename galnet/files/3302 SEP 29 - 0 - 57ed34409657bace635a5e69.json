Scores of independent pilots responded to the organisation's request, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Obsidian Orbital, the organisation's base of operations. The materials will be used to construct a new Imperial operating base in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system.\nThe spokesperson released a statement.\n\"I know there are some who decry the Empire for its part in this conflict. They believe that if we simply walked away, the conflict would end. But sometimes the only way to achieve peace is by opposing the tyrannical.\"\nPilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:42:12Z","deprecated":false}
