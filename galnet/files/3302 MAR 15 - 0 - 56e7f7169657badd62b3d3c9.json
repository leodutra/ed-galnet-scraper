It also claims that the deaths of Federal Vice-President Nigel Smeaton, Sean Richards, Arnold Lowe, Susan Monroe, Elaine Boyd, Emperor Hengist Duval and the disappearances of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey and Professor Ishmael Palin are similarly connected.\nThe message concluded: \"Many of those who have tried to connect these seemingly disparate events have been silenced, along with their sources. That is why I have chosen to remain anonymous. So far, only pawns have been revealed in this shadowy game. We must discover the king.\"\nNeither the Federation nor the Empire has chosen to comment on the transmission.\nCommander Corrigendum","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:05:15Z","deprecated":false}
