Fortunately, Utopia is willing to pay above-market prices for these materials, which will play a central role in our forthcoming programme.\"\nThe campaign begins on the 13th of April 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:04:24Z","deprecated":false}
