Without it, Vespera will be unable to return home.\nBut Commander Vespera is unconcerned â€“ in fact, she's jubilant.\n\"I got a message saying that Jaques Station is coming to Beagle Point. I might actually be the first to meet him here!\"\nLisbeth Moore","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:32:13Z","deprecated":false}
