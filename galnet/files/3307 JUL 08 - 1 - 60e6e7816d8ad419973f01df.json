The victory also inspired the Coalition of Uteran, Lp 726-6 Free and Gluscap Labour factions to secede from the Federation, affecting all systems under their control.\nMayor Constanza Noguera, leader of Azaladshu Free, declared:\n“A Federation that abuses the rights of its people has no authority. With the help of our loyal supporters, we’ve made a stand for dignity and civil rights.”\nThe situation has caused turmoil in Congress, with President Zachary Hudson being criticised for his inability to contain this rebellion. \nShadow President Felicia Winters responded to accusations that she orchestrated the seceding factions:\n“I support their rejection of our harsh surveillance laws, but not their methods of protest. I have no wish to see the Federation lose member systems for any reason.”\nPilots who supported the Azaladshu Free faction can collect their rewards at Eratosthenes Ring station.","extractionDate":"2021-07-12T21:46:23Z","deprecated":false}
