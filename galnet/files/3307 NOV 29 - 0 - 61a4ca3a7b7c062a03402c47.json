After failing to achieve this, most of the Musashi’s crewmembers were detained and repatriated to their respective home systems to face civil or military charges.\nThe Federal Navy has published this official notice:\n“Admiral Tanner is formally accused of mutiny and unlawful military action while in command of the Musashi. He will stand trial in a general court-martial. If found guilty, he will be dishonourably discharged and imprisoned for life.”\nDr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry into Aegis, commented:\n“Recent events in the T Tauri system clearly fall within the scope of our investigation. For Aegis’s chief military liaison to launch an unauthorised attack, at the cost of many lives, will weigh heavily against the organisation.”\nAdmiral Tanner claims that the anti-xeno superweapon deployed by Salvation in the Cornsar system has triggered an increase in Thargoid attacks. Although there is no direct evidence of this, the Thargoids have performed coordinated strikes against several systems in the weeks since that event.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:24:29Z","deprecated":false}
