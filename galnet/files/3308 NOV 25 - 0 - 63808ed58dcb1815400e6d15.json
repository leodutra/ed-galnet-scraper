Medical teams are currently exploring the wreckage of the megaship in search of crew and passengers. Sadly, from what I’ve seen, the scale of the damage suggests that the chances of survival are extremely low.”\n“Further confirmation came with the discovery of a log made by Dr Elias Pope of Orion University, who was overseeing attempts to communicate with the Thargoids. Although I have yet to hear this recording myself, it apparently describes exactly what happened when the Taranis anomaly passed through the system.”\n“As news of the tragedy spreads, it has triggered a vociferous backlash against the Thargoid Advocacy Project. This fringe group recently gained a degree of respectability with the involvement of Congressman Dalton Chase and other media figures. But now there is widespread anger that, as Sol Today’s editorial put it, ‘Thousands of people were sent to die based on a vague hope that these alien warmongers might suddenly play nice.’”\n“Congressman Chase himself told the press that he is reviewing the latest reports from Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1, and cannot yet make any official comment. As the public face of the Kingfisher mission, it’s likely that any formal demands for accountability will be directed his way.”\n“Meanwhile, Taranis draws ever closer to human-inhabited space. The Kingfisher’s destruction proves definitively that the rogue signal sources are of Thargoid origin, and that their intentions are hostile. With the prospect of the Second Thargoid War escalating to new levels, tensions throughout the core systems have never been higher.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:21:44Z","deprecated":false}
