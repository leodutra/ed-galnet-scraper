It consists of ships crewed by Imperator Mordanticus’s ex-Navy followers, as well as the private vessels of many misguided citizens.”\n“As Admiral of the Fleet, I order Nova Imperium to disperse its forces immediately or face the consequences.”\nThe Imperial Herald’s Cassia Carvalho commented:\n“Widespread support for Hadrian Duval has led to Nova Imperium amassing its fleet in a very short time. The challenge for the Imperial Navy is to quash this threat without it being seen as a massacre of Imperial citizens, which can only fuel further rebellion.”"}
