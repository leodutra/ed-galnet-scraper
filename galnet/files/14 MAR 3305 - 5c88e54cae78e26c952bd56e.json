It’s evident that personnel are obeying the cultists’ orders for fear that they will use the Lucifer Device.”\n“Millions of people remain at the starport, making a frontal assault too risky. FIA negotiators are taking steps to open a dialogue and resolve the situation peacefully.”\nThe cult’s leader, Barnabas Cole, transmitted a brief message using Archambault terminal’s communications array:\n“At last, we have found the place where our testament’s light will shine. Join us. When the ceremony is complete, you will all see Tothos as we do.”"}
