But recent reports from Maia indicate that the Federal ships have now withdrawn, effectively ending the cordon of Maia A 3 a.\nRici Stewart, writing for The Imperial Herald, offering the following evaluation:\n“The Federation knows that blockading Professor Palin was – at best – unethical, so I’m not surprised they chose not to comment on their withdrawal. They just slipped away in the night.”\n“As with their efforts to control meta-alloys, the Federation’s attempts to restrict access to Palin’s base were far from successful. I guess the Federation has realised it can’t control the galaxy. If you ask me, this is another sign that the Federal-Imperial cold war could be coming to an end.”\nNaturally, Professor Palin was pleased with the development:\n“We may never know exactly why the Federation blockaded Maia A 3 a. Frankly, the galaxy’s superpowers have always been rather incomprehensible to me. All I can say is: I’m glad they’re gone.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:33:08Z","deprecated":false}
