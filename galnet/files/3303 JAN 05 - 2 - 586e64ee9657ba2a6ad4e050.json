A bulletin from the organisation confirms that pilots who deliver mined osmium, praseodymium and methanol monohydrate crystals to Tiedemann Dock in the Balones system will be generously rewarded.\nA spokesperson for the organisation elaborated on the nature of the project:\n\"The purpose of this programme is to develop a number of advanced deep-space probes â€“ ones that will reveal more about what lies beyond the borders of our galaxy.\"\n\"We at Balones Gold Touch Systems believe galactic civilisation is on the cusp of a paradigm shift. The alien shipwrecks and the Synuefe ruins leave no room for doubt: we are not alone in the universe.\"\n\"Knowledge is the currency of the future. Not money. Not weapons. Knowledge. And how best to acquire this knowledge? With the instruments that Balones Gold Touch Systems is developing.\"\nThe campaign begins on the 5th of January 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:50:38Z","deprecated":false}
