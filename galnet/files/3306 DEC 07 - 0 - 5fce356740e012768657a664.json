Other investors have publicly pressured the company to accept a takeover bid from the Federal corporation Core Dynamics.\nThese issues were addressed by Naomi Landseer, chairperson of Lakon’s board of directors:\n“It is true that profit margins are not as impressive as in previous years, but we can assure all stakeholders and customers that Lakon Spaceways remains financially secure. We project an upswing in military contracts during this turbulent time, and our achievements on behalf of the Alliance position us as one of the galaxy’s premiere shipbuilders.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:17:45Z","deprecated":false}
