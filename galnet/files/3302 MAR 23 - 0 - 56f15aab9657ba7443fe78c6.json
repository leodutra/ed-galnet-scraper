His keynote address was on the Cerberus plague.\n\"The original Cerberus plague spread to over 30 systems inside a month, putting billions of lives at risk,\" said Simmons. \"It is unlikely we would have been able to eradicate the disease had the cure been discovered any later, as ceremonial Heike tea would not have been available in sufficient quantities. Trillions could have perished.\"\n\"We cannot afford to underestimate this new strain of Cerberus plague, and I urge the medical community to take the outbreak seriously. If Heike tea is not delivered in sufficient quantities, or if this strain proves resistant to the tea's effects, the consequences could be catastrophic.\"\nCommander Corrigendum"}
