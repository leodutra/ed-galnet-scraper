It has acted as his intermediary in recent months, directly supporting his efforts to combat the Thargoids.\nDr Ruben Carpenter, head of the company’s research division, provided a statement:\n“We have recorded some unusual radioactive signatures in the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system. This has had a transformative effect on the molecular structure of certain naturally occurring substances.”\n“Our objective is to perform a detailed analysis of these irradiated materials and determine if they have value as mineable resources. Customised laboratories have been set up aboard both megaships, and work is already underway.”\nThe Empirical, an independent journal aimed at the scientific community, commented:\n“As yet, the detection of atypical radiation signatures within CE-R c21-6 has not been verified by secondary sources. Our editorial team has reached out to Taurus Mining Ventures for clarification.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:17:15Z","deprecated":false}
