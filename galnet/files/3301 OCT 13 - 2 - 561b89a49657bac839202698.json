Now the organisation believes it has decoded at least part of these strange transmissions. Startlingly, the messages appear to contain schematic diagrams of the ships being used to study the objects.\nThe breakthrough came when Commander Mike Juliett Kilo was inspired to channel a pre-recorded AEO signal into an antique scanner display system he happened to be transporting. \"I was prepared to see an alien face or Thargoid warship,\" he said. \"I certainly didn't expect to see a Vulture, especially as I was flying one at the time! It sent shivers down my spine.\"\nAs the number of AEOs encountered in the Aries Dark region increases, the debate over the objects continues.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:26:48Z","deprecated":false}
