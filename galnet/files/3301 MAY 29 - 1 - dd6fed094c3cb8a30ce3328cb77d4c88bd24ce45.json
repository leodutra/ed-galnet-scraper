In his address to Congress, Shadow President Hudson has made it clear the situation needs a resolution.\n“These are uncertain times and, with no disrespect to Jasmina’s memory, we need to put an end to this weak administration and bring our beloved Federation back on track. We cannot allow ourselves the luxury of wallowing in this state of horrendous disarray for even a moment longer.”\n“Had Jasmina returned, it would have made no difference. She was away trying to raise support from the frontier as she knew this vote of no confidence was coming. I call for it now. Let’s get it out of the way and move on, here on Mars and throughout the Federation.”\n“We are not some Imperial dynasty. We do not allow the whims of our dead to dictate terms to the living.”\n“As such, in her absence, and without any ill intent towards Secretary Winters, I am issuing a call for a vote of no confidence against the current administration.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:11:35Z","deprecated":false}
