The engineer asked pilots to deliver data from the site to his laboratory in the hope that he would be able to decipher it.\nBut Ran Tah's silence has prompted some to speculate that the engineer might not be up to the task of decoding the data, and that his attempt was nothing more than the naive dream of a backwater mechanic.\nWhen approached with these criticisms, Ram Tah said:\n\"These things take time. I believe I have made a breakthrough, but I will not be pressured into offering untested claims. As soon as I have results, the galaxy will know.\""}
