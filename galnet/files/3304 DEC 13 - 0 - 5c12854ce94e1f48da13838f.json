Other pilots protected the rare goods from being taken by pirates.\nBarnabas Cole, leader of the Children of Tothos, gave another handwritten message to the media:\n“By helping us, you free yourselves. You will feel the light of our testament fill you, just as it fills the heavens.”\nThe initiative was organised by Zlota Federal Holdings, which allegedly counts some high-ranking officials as cult members. Contributing pilots can now collect their rewards from Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:52:28Z","deprecated":false}
