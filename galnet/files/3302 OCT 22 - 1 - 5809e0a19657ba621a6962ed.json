Rosaline Merden, acting Chair of MetaDrive, was clearly pleased with the outcome. At a press conference, she said:\n\"The board of MetaDrive wholeheartedly welcomes the security this acquisition brings. As part of the Sirius Corporation, the MetaDrive brand will continue to go from strength to strength.\"\nReporters asked about the ongoing audit of MetaDrive, and also the fate of former employee Raan Corsen, who was reported missing a couple of weeks ago.\n\"The audit has been successfully completed and all assets are in the hands of Sirius Corporation,\" said Merden. \"Raan Corsen's employment was terminated prior to the takeover.\"\nMerden was challenged by a representative of the Earth Defence Fleet, who alleged that Raan Corsen had in fact fled from Sirius security forces and been killed in the Alioth system.\n\"Mr Corsen's business in the Alioth system was his own,\" said Merden. \"It has nothing to do with the Sirius Corporation.\"\nThe press conference closed with outstanding questions, but reporters managed to get a final word from Commander MoonWeb of the Earth Defence Fleet.\n\"According to our intel, Corsen was pursued before crash-landing on a planet in the Alioth system. This was observed by Commander Ashley Wilkinson, a Canonn representative working with the Earth Defence Fleet.\"\n\"The specifics surrounding Corsen's demise are not known, but we have a transcript of his final transmission that points a finger squarely at the Sirius Corporation.\"","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:19:04Z","deprecated":false}
