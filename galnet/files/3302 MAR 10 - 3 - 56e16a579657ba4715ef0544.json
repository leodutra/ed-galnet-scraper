All the necessary materials for the starport have now been received, and the agitators disrupting delivery operations have been neutralised. A spokesperson for the Pilots Federation, which helped to organise the campaign, released a brief statement:\n\"Once again the galaxy's independent pilots have demonstrated their remarkable commitment and resolve. This new starport will facilitate travel and trade throughout LHS 3447, and serve as a testament to the dedication and altruism of the galactic community.\"\nBluford Orbital is expected to open its doors in the next few days."}
