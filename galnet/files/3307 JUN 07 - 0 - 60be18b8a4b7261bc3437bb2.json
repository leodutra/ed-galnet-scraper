We can help replace desperate acts of rebellion with meaningful dialogue and public pressure.”\nSeveral newsfeeds observed that Whyte was attempting to rebrand Neo-Marlinism as being closer to the mainstream ideals of Marlinism. However, the possibility that the faction may now act as the political wing of the NMLA has caused widespread alarm.\nIn related news, a recent election in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system saw voters remove the Marlinism Reformation Party from power, after it granted asylum to survivors from the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.\nThe system’s new leader, Minister Octavia Volkov of the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine, announced:\n“My party believes in following Marlin Duval’s example by building independent democracies, rather than reforming the Empire. However, three of our colony systems have already fallen under the control of foreign factions. We urgently need support to keep the dream of a Marlinist Republic alive.”","extraction_date":"2021-07-12T21:46:08Z","deprecated":false}
