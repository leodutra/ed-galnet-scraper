It is estimated that 9,322 innocent Federal civilians lost their lives in the attack.\nThe President claims that she was presented with evidence by the Joint Intelligence Committee which confirmed that Éamonn Uí Laoghire, leader of the Crimson State Group, would be aboard one of the transports with his entourage.\nHowever, sources close to the Crimson State Group claim that reports of Éamonn’s presence on the refugee ships were nothing more than fabrications. \nShadow President Hudson has sworn that an official investigation into the matter will be launched once the current crisis is over.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:37:09Z","deprecated":false}
