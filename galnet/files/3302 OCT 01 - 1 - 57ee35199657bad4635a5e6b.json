Shortly before the ship was laid to rest, a beacon aboard the vessel transmitted a repeating sequence of curious characters.\nThe sequence was picked up by several listening and relay posts in the Tionisla system, and it has now been determined that it contains content obscured with an unknown encryption. The encrypted data is followed by an apparently meaningless clear-text phrase: 'The vain queen rides a giraffe that remembers her daughter's hero.'\nIntelligence services within the Alliance, Empire and Federation are said to be investigating the message, but no official statements have yet been made. Both the sender and intended recipient of the message remain a mystery.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:42:57Z","deprecated":false}
