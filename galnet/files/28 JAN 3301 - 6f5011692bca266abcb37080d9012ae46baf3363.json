We won't let the system succumb to tyranny again!” \nCommander Ulysses Wolf, an Imperial Explorer, also hit back, “We won't just stand by and let it happen!”\nMany other pilots also voiced their discontent, suggesting that if a French Coalition did attempt a takeover they'd have more than just local Alliance Forces to deal with. President James Gibson of Lave couldn't be reached for comment."}
