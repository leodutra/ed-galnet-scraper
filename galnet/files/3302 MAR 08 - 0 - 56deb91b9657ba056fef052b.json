As such, they have served notice regarding the name 'PanGalactic', and will pursue the case vigorously.\"\nLegal experts are intrigued by the case as it could set a precedent for galaxy-wide intellectual property rights. Professor Janus of the Federal Bar Council ventured that: \"It would be an interesting case, if it were heard, although it does highlight the need for more closely aligned intellectual property law.\"\nIt seems Oliver Gordon's no-holds-barred approach to cuisine may have thrown him from the frying pan into the fire.\nCommander Matzov","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:31:40Z","deprecated":false}
