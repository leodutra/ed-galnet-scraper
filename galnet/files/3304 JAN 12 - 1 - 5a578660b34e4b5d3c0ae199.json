Pilots who support these campaigns will be eligible for substantial rewards.\nFollowing the announcement, Admiral Denton Patreus released the following statement:\n“Starports throughout the Pleiades have been attacked. Thousands of lives have been lost. And we have failed to deliver an effective response. That changes now.”\n“This is your chance to deliver a message to our enemies – to tell them that we will not yield and we will not break. We will fight!”\nThe campaign begins on the 11th of January 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:55:29Z","deprecated":false}
