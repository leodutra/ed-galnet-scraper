The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure those contributing commodities to the campaign can do so safely.\nMoritasgus Imperial Corporation spokesperson Superintendent Arnold Cochran released the following statement:\n“We are pleased the Empire has awarded us this contract, and we look forward to the first ships arriving with our new guests.”\nThe campaign begins on the 10th May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:50:57Z","deprecated":false}
