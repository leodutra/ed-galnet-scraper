Project leader Erimus Kamzel told the media:\n“The Distant Worlds fleet is privileged to be at the forefront of this ambitious industrial and scientific initiative – humanity’s first starport in the Galactic Centre region.”\nIndependent miners are invited to deliver shipments of Indite, Gallite, Praseodymium and Cobalt to Omega Mining Operation in the Omega Sector VE-Q b5-15 system.\nIn order to protect traders, the Omega Mining Corporation has also placed kill orders on all ships on its wanted list.\nThe initiative begins on the 17th of January 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:37:05Z","deprecated":false}
