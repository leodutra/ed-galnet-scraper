However, the Thargoid forces proved to be overwhelming and have attacked systems within the nebulas, with the loss of thousands of lives. \nAdmiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison of Aegis, broadcast this message:\n“Despite the heroic efforts of many pilots, the alien ships have resisted being driven from the Witch Head Nebula.”\n“Aegis’s military capability and manpower are both severely limited as a result of curtailed funding from the Empire and the Federation. We have no choice but to rely on independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons as the first line of defence against the Thargoid threat.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:59:47Z","deprecated":false}
