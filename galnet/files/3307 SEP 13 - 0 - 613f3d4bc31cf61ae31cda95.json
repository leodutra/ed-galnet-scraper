It’s clear that their populations feel empowered to take a stand against losing their constitutional rights of privacy.”\n“Vice President Archer shrugged off this latest development, maintaining that ‘the Proactive Detection Bureau performs a vital security role in these troubled times’. Since none of these latest factions currently govern a system, he may also believe that resistance to the PDB is on the wane.”\n“Although these events have only impacted a small part of Federal territory, they remain an embarrassment for President Hudson’s administration. Shadow President Winters continues to implore Congress to repeal the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, but she has also taken political criticism since many feel her rhetoric inspired these factions to secede.”","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:26:49Z","deprecated":false}
