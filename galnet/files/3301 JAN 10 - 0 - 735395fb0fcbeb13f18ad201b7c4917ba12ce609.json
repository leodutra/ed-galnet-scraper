We will have the system back in working order soon.\"\nSenator Torval has paid generous combat bonds to independent ships that have helped her in large numbers over the last few weeks. It is understood the ringleaders of the Sorbago rebellion were executed.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:27:17Z","deprecated":false}
