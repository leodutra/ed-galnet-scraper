A charismatic member of the expedition – a Commander by the name of Salomé – was among the first to arrive at Beagle Point.\nA total of 23 pre-arranged waypoints have helped to organise the fleet and facilitate social interaction, including SRV races. Unfortunately, this coordination has not completely mitigated losses: of the 1,000 commanders who set out for Beagle Point, it is estimated that only 25% have survived the 81,500 light-year journey, and it's likely that the return journey will result in further losses.\nCommander Corrigendum","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:48:50Z","deprecated":false}
