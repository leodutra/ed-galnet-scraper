The plan is apparently to force Duval into admitting the foolishness of the Pegasi War by bringing it as close to home as possible.\nOperation Uranus saw the Kumo Crew pirates target worlds under the influence of Senator Denton Patreus, but this is the first time they have been bold enough to strike farther afield. Only time will tell what impact this will have on the Imperial power players.\nCommander Mikalus","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:45:44Z","deprecated":false}
