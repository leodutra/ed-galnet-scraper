Aegis researchers have now gathered enough evidence to confirm a tactical shift.\nThe Thargoids have adopted a more defensive stance, reinforcing their current position rather than expanding outward. They are also targeting and invading populated systems exclusively, sometimes without their normal scouting operations.\nDr. Jeong-Hui Shing of the Holloway Bioscience institute offered the following view:\n“That lack of scouting is the most fascinating element of this change to me. A military man may claim it to be a desperate enemy lashing out at its opponent, but I see something deeper.”\n “Foregoing expansion to prioritise the defence of their remaining Titans is intelligent, not desperate. These attacks seem just as calculated: they are gathering data. Probing our defences. Analysing where their remaining resources may be best used...”\nAs a tactical response, various organisations will be sending strike teams to designated counterstrike systems around the Titan with the least systems under Thargoid control. Where possible, these teams plan to reactivate a single port within each system to provide a forward operating base for anti-xeno operations.\nPilots are being encouraged to take up arms and participate in the defence of these forward ports.","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:39:05Z","deprecated":false}
