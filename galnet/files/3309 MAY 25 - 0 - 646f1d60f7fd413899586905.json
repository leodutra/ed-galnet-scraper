Reaching these gargantuan objects is hazardous since it involves travelling through the Maelstroms’ corrosive environment, avoiding hostile Thargoid vessels along the way. But even at close range, ship sensors have been unable to obtain meaningful data on their composition.”\n“In response, Aegis has fast-tracked a project to modify the xeno scanner originally developed by Professor Ishmael Palin. This adaption utilises the electromagnetic technology found in pulse wave analysers, casting the scanner’s range over a much broader area.”\n“Simulated tests show that the pulse wave xeno scanner should be able to identify points of interest on a Titan’s hull. But the research effort requires as many pilots as possible to verify our findings out in the field. We are therefore gathering the supplies needed to manufacture the module in large quantities.”\nAegis will reward pilots who transport shipments of ceramic composites, polymers, gallium and indium to Muller Terminal in the Rabh system. These will be used to establish manufacturing centres for pulse wave xeno scanners, which will then be rapidly distributed to all rescue megaships. A secondary campaign will reward pilots for protecting deliveries from pirates.","extractionDate":"2023-06-23T20:13:27Z","deprecated":false}
