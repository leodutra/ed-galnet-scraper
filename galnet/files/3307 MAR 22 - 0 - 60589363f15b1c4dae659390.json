Worryingly, the NMLA’s new generation of weapons seem to be easier to transport and conceal.”\n“The good news is that a comparison of reports has revealed one very promising lead. I will personally take a team to follow this up, and we’re hoping for an early breakthrough.”\nInspector Mara Klatt also provided a brief progress report:\n“Our working theory is that the NMLA employs an undetectable interstellar communications system to coordinate its attacks. A similar dark-comms network was used by the League of Reparation before we decrypted it, but this version is evidently more sophisticated. We are liaising with local security services to gather evidence.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-24T01:24:12Z","deprecated":false}
