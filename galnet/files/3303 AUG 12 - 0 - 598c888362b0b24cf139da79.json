But Sirius is playing the long game. They’ve positioned themselves close to the barnacles so that if the Federation pulls out of the system, they can swoop in and start hoovering up meta-alloys.”\nThe new outposts will no doubt be a boon to independent pilots in Merope, giving them access to a wide range of services."}
