Hundreds of privately owned Federation-registered vessels have turned out to greet the Senator, in lieu of an official welcome, as she continues her passage through the Sol system despite continued apathy from officials.\nRequests for interviews from the diplomatic representatives on Mars have been turned down, but one, rather stressed, aide was quoted as saying, \"Listen.
