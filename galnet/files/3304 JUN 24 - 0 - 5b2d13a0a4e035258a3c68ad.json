Although the Thargoids remain entrenched in the Pleiades, their forces in the core systems have been pushed back to the Bhal system, their initial beachhead.\nIn related news, Aegis has confirmed that three starports attacked and damaged by Thargoid forces have now been restored to full functionality, following supportive efforts from the galactic community. The pertinent starports are Armstrong Enterprise in the Bhal system, Beaufoy Vision in the Nauni system and Reed's Rest in the Merope system.\nIn other news, Princess Aisling Duval has announced that she is to wed Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester. Both Princess Duval and Mr Rochester expressed hope that their marriage would strengthen ties between the Empire and the Federation. There has been no official comment from the Imperial Palace or the White House on the engagement.\nA homicide attempt by terrorist organisation the League of Reparation has been foiled, and the would-be killers taken into custody. Kay Kilbride of Alliance Interpol confirmed that the captives had been transported to a secure facility for interrogation, with a view to establishing the identity of Nexus – the League’s apparent coordinator.\nMeanwhile, renowned billionaire Zachary Rackham, owner of Rackham Capital Investments, has made a sizeable charitable donation to build new shipyards in the Colonia region. Every planetary port in the region, bar Colonia Hub, will soon be able to offer pilots a full range of services.\nAegis has announced plans to build a military installation in the Pleiades. An Aegis spokesperson confirmed that the development was a response to the recent occupation of the Socho system –headquarters of Aegis Core – by a hostile criminal element. Aegis Research has placed an open order for mined resources for use in the construction.\nFinally, Senator Caspian Leopold has announced that his appeal for commodities has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community.
