The report reveals that Mordanticus still has contacts and influence in the Imperial Navy, and that Nova Imperium’s ships are mostly run by ex-naval crews.\nMeanwhile, an Achilles Corporation engineer who helped design the robots at the heart of the spy robot scandal has given evidence to former FSS inspector Ramesh Thorne. The engineer claims she was blackmailed by Kingsley Cordova, owner of the Mars Tribune, into installing surveillance programs on PA912 administration robots. All the affected robots have now been made safe.\nIn other news, the Independent HIP 29241 Green Party operation to recover escape pods in the Meene system has reached a successful conclusion. The captured mercenaries were interrogated by the Meene Defence Force, leading to the realisation that several of them were junior officers in Sirius Corp’s private fleet. The engineer Ram Tah, who operates from Phoenix Base in the Meene system, has claimed that Sirius is trying to obtain his research by force. The Sirius Corporation has refuted any allegations of criminal activity.\nFinally, Olelbis Holdings, an organisation based in the Olelbis system, has announced an elaborate social function at Polyakov Orbital, the faction’s base of operations. In support of this event, Olelbis Holdings has placed an open order for various rare commodities, and has pledged to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Polyakov Orbital in the Olelbis system.\nPopular author Olav Redcourt, who was recently reported missing, has been found alive and well at a writers’ retreat at a remote outpost. The writer is apparently hard at work on his new book, a science fiction novel.\nAnd those are the main stories this week.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:08:53Z","deprecated":false}
