Boom can also positively increase a minor faction's influence. Boom can be entered by consistent trade profits and completed trade contracts. Booms tend to last until they naturally expire or until some other indicator takes precedence, such as famine.\nHere are 10 of the 600 factions currently experiencing economic bust:\nNjorog Democrats\nFurbaide Syndicate\nPand Inc\nWandjin Boys\nWolf 896 Crimson Crew\nOfficial Rajukru Party\nLHS 1446 Blue Partnership\nLeague of George Pantazis Defence Force\nHIP 101846 Crimson Fortune\nIntegrated Qahat\nThe wealth of a system diminishes while in bust and the minor faction's influence is also lessened. The effect of trade contracts and actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust generally has to run its course before ending.\nData is correct at time of publishing.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:58:55Z","deprecated":false}
