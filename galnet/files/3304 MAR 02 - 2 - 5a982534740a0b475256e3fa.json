The initiative is a direct response to ongoing Thargoid hostility.\nA spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation elaborated on the nature of the campaign:\n“Several members of our organisation have friends and family in Colonia, so we’ve decided to divert some cash into protecting the region. If the Thargoids come knocking, we don’t want the people of Colonia to be caught with their pants down.”\nArek Crimson Vision Corporation has placed an open order for a range of weapons, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested goods to Gold Hub in the Arek system.\nThe campaign begins on the 1st of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:51:47Z","deprecated":false}
