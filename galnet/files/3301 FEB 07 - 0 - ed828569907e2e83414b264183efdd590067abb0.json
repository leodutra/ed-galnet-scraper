It’s mission? To discover new beverages, explore distant stars, and bravely go where no starport had been before.

His unit was captured by enemy forces during the Battle of Hell’s Gate. \nThe intrepid ex-soldier spent close to the next 200 years improving his cybernetic implants and saving up to buy the station in order to head off and explore the stars in style, and he is happy for people to join him.
