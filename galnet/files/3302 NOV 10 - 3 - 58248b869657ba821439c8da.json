According to the organisation's spokesperson, the resources will be used in an unspecified research and development project.\nDr Arkady Cole, the organisation's chief research scientist, released the following statement:\n\"We want the resources, yes? Very useful to us. Process is simple. Deliver the resources and be paid. Yes.\"\nDespite the opaque nature of the request, it is likely the generous reimbursements offered by the Zosi Major Corporation will ensure its orders are met. Participating pilots have been instructed to deliver the requested commodities to Citi Enterprise in the Zosi system.\nThe campaign begins on the 10th of November and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
