A simple scan and visual check will confirm spike maturity.\"\n\"Further testing will be needed to determine the specifics, but with the crisis facing civilised space, conducting controlled experiments on barnacles has become next to impossible.\"\n\"The way things are going, we risk losing these magnificent entities for good.\"\nCommander BluWolve","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:10:40Z","deprecated":false}
