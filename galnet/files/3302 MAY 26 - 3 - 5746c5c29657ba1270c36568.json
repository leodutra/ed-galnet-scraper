The campaign received the support of hundreds of Alliance-aligned pilots who, along with other members of the galactic community, delivered essential materials and components to the Alliance base at Noti Dock.\nNow, Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has announced that the new outpost is complete. In a statement, Mahon said:\n\"It gives me great pleasure to announce the formal opening of the Cooper Research Centre. In addition to functioning as a base for scientific research, the station will bolster the Alliance's reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering capabilities in a strategically valuable region of space.\"\nAn Alliance spokesperson confirmed that the new outpost would offer reload, repair and refuel services to pilots operating in the HIP 19072 system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:04:09Z","deprecated":false}
