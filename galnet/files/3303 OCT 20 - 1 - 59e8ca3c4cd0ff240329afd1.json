Hundreds of independent pilots supported the initiative by taking to their ships to deliver commodities to Cremona Prospect. The materials will be used to test and mass-produce a shutdown-field neutraliser, developed by engineer Elvira Martuuk, which will counter the Thargoids’ ability to disable human spacecraft.\nMartuuk released a brief statement to the media:\n“I want to thank those who hauled stuff out to Cremona Prospect. I just hope the tech I’ve developed will make a difference to the Commanders on the front lines.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Cremona Prospect in the Khun system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:57:59Z","deprecated":false}
