Coming out of the Office for Marriage with her Lawyer she read a prepared statement from a cue -\n“I have lodged a formal objection to my grandfather marrying his fancy woman not for love, not for marriage itself, but to change the succession without having to appear in the Senate. That’s all I’ve got to say at this time.”\nThis unusual action will trigger a hearing of the Marriage Council in the next few days. They will review and make a decision on the validity of her objection. Experts we have spoken to believe it is unlikely to succeed.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:18:16Z","deprecated":false}
