Threats of piracy and violent protest have already reached the system.\nTo counter these threats, a collective of former security contractors known as the Praetorians have committed their forces to defending Mundjiga and the traders operating there. Loren's Legion, an extension of the Prism defence force, will operate jointly with the Praetorians, protecting traders sourcing tantalum from Prism.\nDuke Alden Rowe, leader of the Praetorians, gave the following statement to the press:\n\"Loyal members of the Imperial Navy Auxiliary, we cannot permit interference with the construction of this critical asset. We must enforce Imperial law and the will of Admiral Patreus by protecting vessels delivering cargo to Sagan Port. We will be a shield for this new Interdictor until it is ready to be a shield for the Empire.\"\nCommander Corrigendum, Loren's Legion","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:22:04Z","deprecated":false}
