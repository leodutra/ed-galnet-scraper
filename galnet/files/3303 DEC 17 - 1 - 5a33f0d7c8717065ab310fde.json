The vessel, which has been named the Type-10 Defender, represents a comprehensive revision of the Type–9 Heavy.\nLakon issued the following statement:\n“The Type-10 boasts greater speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability than the Type-9, and also offers a more focused hardpoint loadout. We envisage it being particularly effective in combat situations.”\nThe development is significant in that it represents the first overtly military response from the Alliance to the rising Thargoid threat.\nLakon has committed to an aggressive production schedule that should see the Type-10 reaching retailers next week.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:36:24Z","deprecated":false}
