Representatives of Core Dynamics have confirmed that this most recent delay is due to faulty sensor and turret targeting arrays. \nThe faults first came to light when engineers began running the FNS Nevermore through its standard weapon diagnostic checks late last week. According to Core Dynamics, the FNS Nevermore’s weapon systems gave engineers the all clear, but upon attempting to fire on the target drone ship, the FNS Nevermore instead released a massive volley into Hudson Dock. \nThe dock’s defence systems then returned fire, causing the Nevermore’s automated battle systems to kick in, resulting in an all-out fight between the two stellar titans. \nIt took engineers three hours to regain control of the ship. During this time dozens of people were killed, and hundreds of millions of credits in damages were done to both structures.\nCommander Lokquine, a member of Hudson Dock’s Shipyard Union, had this to say on the matter:\n“Well honestly, what do you expect to happen when you build a ship like that out of so much Copper? I told them they should have used Gold, cheap << censored >>.” \nCore Dynamics is now looking for traders to help bring a variety of Metals to Hudson Dock to assist in the repair efforts.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:57:38Z","deprecated":false}
