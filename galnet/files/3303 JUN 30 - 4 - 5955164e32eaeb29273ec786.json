The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering material to Stone Enterprise can do so safely.\nThe campaign begins on the 29th of July 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
