An accompanying note explained that the production technique has remained largely unchanged since the 22nd century. \nAnalysis of the beverage confirmed it was safe for consumption, although nothing is known of the raw ingredients or distillation process.\nAs yet very few people have sampled Apa Vietii, but the celebrated gourmet and critic Giles Cappelleo was invited to appraise the spirit:\n“Well, what a delight this is – to experience a previously unheard-of libation! Apa Vietii is refreshing on the palate with a smooth, crisp flavour, but delivers a vigorous thump to the senses once swallowed. If it ever becomes widely available, connoisseurs everywhere would surely adore it. The Golconda crew is sitting atop a potential goldmine!”\nProfessor Elizabeth Perez of the Orion Independent University provided an anthropologist’s take:\n“This is a significant gesture from a society that has been highly reluctant to interact with outsiders. Although their isolationist stance remains prevalent, offering Apa Vietii could be interpreted as the start of a cultural exchange programme prior to rejoining civilisation.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:04:52Z","deprecated":false}
