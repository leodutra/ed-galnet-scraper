Political commentators were quick to point out, however, that the demonstration could not have taken place without his foreknowledge, if not his explicit approval.\nIn an address to the crowd, Halsey said:\n“As a 20th Century historian once wrote, ‘The underlying reason for war is always economic.’ This conflict has nothing to do with freedom or liberation – it is about resources. And I believe enough people have died to line the pockets of already wealthy individuals in the Federation and the Empire.”\n“I speak now directly to President Zachary Hudson and Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval: It is not too late for you to listen to reason.”\nNeither the Empire nor the Federation elected to respond to Halsey’s statement."}
