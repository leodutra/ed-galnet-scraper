Megaships in the area have also been attacked and left in disrepair, with surviving crews activating distress signals.\nHarrison Gladstone, a spokesperson for Turner Research Group which oversees Allied operations in the region, gave a statement to Vox Galactica:\n“We’re accustomed to the Thargoid encounters in the California nebula, but this time their aggression caught everyone by surprise. Research teams have been recalled from the region’s barnacle sites. It’s just become too dangerous to send our people out there.”\nColonisation of the California Nebula took place in 3302 and focused primarily on harvesting meta-alloys from Thargoid barnacle sites. Although the enclave was initially established by the Alliance, the Kumo Crew’s expansion into the area last year brought tension.\nThe Tau Ceti Journal reported that these latest attacks may directly impact the meta-alloy market. Some Federal corporations, which directly purchase this material from the Alliance, have warned that fresh sources of meta-alloys could be required to prevent commercial instability.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:16:56Z","deprecated":false}
