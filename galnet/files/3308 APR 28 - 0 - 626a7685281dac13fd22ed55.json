However, Sirius Corporation is keen to show its commitment to helping the Alliance, and will do so by supplying vital resources to the Didio system’s besieged population.”\n“Large quantities of basic medicines, evacuation shelters and food cartridges are urgently required. These can be delivered to the megaship Chariot of Rhea in the Leesti system, from where they will be delivered to Didio in military convoys.”\nSirius Corporation has been criticised for not providing similar support to the Novas and Sosong systems, which have also been invaded. A spokesperson for the megacorp stated that the strategic defence pact’s trial applies exclusively to the Alliance. Any similar relationship with the Empire and Federation would require separate negotiations, though the spokesperson stressed that Li Yong-Rui has no interest in such talks at this time.\nA joint operation between the superpowers is currently underway in Didio, Novas and Sosong to counter recent Thargoid invasions. This is to buy time for Salvation’s anti-xeno superweapons to be constructed.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:13:39Z","deprecated":false}
