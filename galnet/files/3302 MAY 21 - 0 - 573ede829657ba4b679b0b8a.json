This reeks of a cover up.\"\nSpeakers at the rally demanded that the Azaleach Partnership, to which the information was submitted, release the data so its findings could be independently verified.\n\"Science relies on openness, collaboration and peer review,\" argued one speaker. \"It's an integral part of the process. Any conclusions based on secret data should be treated with suspicion.\"\nCommander Corlas","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:13:03Z","deprecated":false}
