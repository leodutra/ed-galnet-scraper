A series of coordinated strikes against the Red Family delivered a mortal blow, and the cartel’s super-addictive narcotic was destroyed before it could be mass-produced.”\n“While kingpin Oberon Church remains at liberty, it is unlikely that he could ever rebuild his empire. Still, losing one of the most wanted criminals in the Federation must be frustrating for the agency.”\nInternal investigations continue regarding Jan Sandoval’s death in custody. No conclusive evidence has been uncovered, but many believe that Sandoval could not be reached without the assistance of FIA personnel.\n“It is not unreasonable to assume that individuals within the FIA have been bought by Church,” said Takahashi.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:51:24Z","deprecated":false}
