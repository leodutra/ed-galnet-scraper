The orders were allegedly provided on a private channel, accompanied by threats discouraging Mr Webster’s refusal.”\n“The trial concluded with the judge summarily convicting the defendant of aiding and abetting mass murder. Chief Technician Webster received a lenient sentence of 20 years in prison, in acknowledgement that he performed criminal acts under duress.”\n“The FIA has detained Vincent in a high-security facility, and he has been charged with conspiracy to commit murder and treason. However, the case is likely to take several months to come to trial.”\nThere was no comment from President Zachary Hudson, who is believed to be a personal friend of Vincent. A spokesperson for his administration said: “As always, the President has full confidence in our court system to deliver justice.”"}
