As soon as I entered witch-space, it was clear something was up with the drive engines. And the navigation system. And the power distributor.\"\n\"Pretty soon I realised I had a choice – push on to Beagle Point and arrive as a cloud of shrapnel, or drop into the nearest safe system. I made the only choice I could – to push on. Then I came to my senses and decided to drop into Eol Prou RS-T d3-94.\"\nJaques was asked if he would be making another attempt to reach Beagle Point.\n\"I don't think Jaques Station will be jumping again anytime soon. The old girl wasn't really built for long-distance travel, and the last leap put a lot of strain on the superstructure. I think I'm going to be in Eol Prou whatever-it's-called for the foreseeable future. Still, the view here is lovely, so it could be worse.\"\nIn related news, various members of the galactic community have begun collecting meta-alloys to repair Jaques Station, and will soon depart for Eol Prou RS-T d3-94."}
