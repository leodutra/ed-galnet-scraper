While local residents were not in favour of the move, the Alliance military was initially slow to take the pirate threat seriously. \nHowever, undercover agents working on behalf of the AEDC have been working tirelessly with local community groups in order to prepare the ground for a swift battle to retake control of Davies High.\nAs planned, the conflict ended swiftly and caused little disruption to the daily life of residents. Pilots from the pirate faction fought fiercely to defend their position, but the combined might of Alliance forces proved too strong, and locals woke this morning to find the \"Pro-Alliance League\" restoring order to their community. \nAlliance approval in Reorte now stands at a staggering 93%!\nElsewhere in the cluster, groups loyal to the Alliance of Independent Systems are visibly taking the pirate threat more seriously. In Lave itself, news of their neighbours' long anticipated victory boosted the ruling \"Workers of Lave Liberals\" by over 20% in a flash opinion poll this morning! The combined influence for Lave's Alliance factions now appears to be over 80%.\nThe burning question on everyone's lips in the Old Worlds is now: \n\"When will Leesti return to the fold?\" \nIt is likely that after reclaiming Reorte with minimal fuss, the experienced negotiators of AEDC are planning something similar in the cluster's most important high-tech trading system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:30:58Z","deprecated":false}
