With its kingpin’s arrest and most remaining forces destroyed, the Red Family organisation no longer exists as a functional crime organisation.”\n“On behalf of the FIA, I am grateful to all pilots who helped eliminate these felons. The United Andowatye Democrats  will redeem bounty vouchers for all contributors at Bosch Station in the Andowatye system.”\nVice President Jerome Archer gave a statement to The Federal Times:\n“One of the Federation’s most notorious organised crime networks has been eradicated, largely due to vital information obtained by the Proactive Detection Bureau. Its ability to unearth enemies of the Federation and bring them to justice remains unparalleled.”\nThe Proactive Detection Bureau was created when Vice President Archer successfully passed public surveillance legislation in 3307. Political commentators have theorised that Archer’s presidential campaign next year will stress the PDB’s role in high-profile victories such as the defeat of Jupiter’s Wrath and Red Family.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:19:40Z","deprecated":false}
