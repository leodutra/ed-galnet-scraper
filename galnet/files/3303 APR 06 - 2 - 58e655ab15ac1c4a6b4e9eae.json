But naturally we do not condone any course of action that could escalate, or perpetuate, this conflict.\"\nBoth the Hand Gang of Gandii and the Gandii Justice Party have set out week-long operations to overcome their rivals, which will begin on the 6th of April 3303.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:20:47Z","deprecated":false}
