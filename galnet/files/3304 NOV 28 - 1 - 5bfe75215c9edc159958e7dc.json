The logs also reveal surprising details about what motivated these individuals to devote themselves to the faith.” \n“Evidence suggests that the settlements on Etain 4a and 4c both came under attack, but whether by Thargoids or human forces is unclear. Mysteriously, no trace remains of the inhabitants.”\n“I am indebted to the explorers who discovered these sites. This information will significantly contribute to the book I am co-writing with Gethin Okonkwo about the Far God religion.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:54:20Z","deprecated":false}
