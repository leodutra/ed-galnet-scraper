We will announce any amendments to the constitution shortly afterwards.”\nMilo Vesper, editor of The Alliance Tribune, discussed this development:\n“President Kincaid’s proposals are seen by some as a long-overdue restructure of the political system. Compared to the current bureaucratic procedure, having a single person make all executive decisions has an obvious appeal. But some in the Assembly are concerned that such changes could imbue the president with emperor-like levels of authority.”\n“Prime Minister Mahon is playing down such fears, but the words ‘constitutional crisis’ have already been heard in Parliament. Whatever happens, this could be the most significant election in the Alliance’s history.”"}
