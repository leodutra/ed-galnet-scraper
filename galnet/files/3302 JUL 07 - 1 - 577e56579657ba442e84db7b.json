A member of the station's technical team confirmed that meta-alloys had been used to partially restore the starport's commodities market, and went on to say:\n\"We're hugely grateful to all the pilots who have so selflessly made the long trek to Eol Prou RS-T d3-94. But we feel bad about not being able to reimburse those who schlepped out here, so we're trying to secure funds for a proper campaign to repair the starport. More details will follow soon.\"\nMeanwhile, reports have surfaced of an increasing number of independent pilots and civilian delegations departing for Eol Prou RS-T d3-94, indicating a strong impulse to establish permanent bases in the region.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:25:18Z","deprecated":false}
