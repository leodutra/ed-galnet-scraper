Those who defy him find themselves shredded apart by a swarm of raging Kumo fighters.\nMany of the Pegasi pirate lords have begun taking orders from Archon. In doing so, they have likewise set themselves up as local warlords who enforce Archonâ€™s will and taxes on those systems too weak to oppose them, while raiding, pillaging and pecking away at those that are not.\nTwo crews in particular, the Hand Gang of Gandii and the Camorra of Krisha, are currently engaged in attempts to take direct control over systems within Archon's domain. If they succeed, they will be accepted as members of the Kumo Crew. If they fail, it is likely none of them will ever be seen again.\nMembers of the Kumo Crew, potential allies and killers for credits alike are all invited to aid the Hand Gang of Gandii and the Camorra of Krisha in their attempts to take over Gandii and Krisha. Pirates wishing to share in the plunder can contact representatives of the crews aboard Lu Hub and Fincke Depot respectively.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:08:48Z","deprecated":false}
