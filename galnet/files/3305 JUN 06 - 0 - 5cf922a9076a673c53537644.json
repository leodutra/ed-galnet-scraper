We don't have a great deal of experience with building, but our intern has an engineering degree and tells us that we'll need specific materials. Bring us those and we'll reward you handsomely!\"\nIn support of this initiative, the organisation has placed an open order for cobalt, titanium and tantalum, with rewards available to pilots who deliver these commodities to McMullen Ring in the Millese system.\nThe campaign will take place between the 6th and 12th of June 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:53:44Z","deprecated":false}
