That’s why we’re offering to replace – free of charge – any robots destroyed or damaged by owners who suspected them of behaving inappropriately.”\n“To achieve this, we’ve asked the Adenets Pro-Alliance Bond to organise deliveries of robotics, computer components and microcontrollers to Henslow Market in the Adenets system. These will be used to produce brand new PA912 administration robots and other models.”\n“The Adenets Pro-Alliance Bond  has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that those delivering commodities can do so safely.\nThe initiative begins on the 29th of November 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:46:23Z","deprecated":false}
