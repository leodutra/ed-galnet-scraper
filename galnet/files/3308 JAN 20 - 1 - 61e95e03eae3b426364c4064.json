Thanks to your hard work, our contract has been renewed for another decade. I like to think that we have also secured the honour of the Federation by stalling the Empire’s plans.”\nRewards for contributors to Caine-Massey are now available for collection at Smith Port in the Dulos system.\nTorval Mining Ltd also received many deliveries of materials but in insufficient quantities to secure the contract. Constantia Torval has confirmed that the pilots who supported their initiative can collect payment at the Pride of Bitterwood megaship.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:16:03Z","deprecated":false}
