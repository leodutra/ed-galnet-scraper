Scores of pilots supported the campaign by delivering commodities to Jahn Dock. These will be used to research the possibility of an automated Federal defence force.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters released a statement:\n“My sincere gratitude goes to those who supported this campaign. But I want to remind you that we’re still some way from a fully automated defence force. The Bulwark Project’s initial remit is simply to establish the economic and military feasibility of such an enterprise.”\nMeanwhile, opponents have continued to voice concerns that it could lead to the development of artificial intelligence, which is outlawed throughout the galaxy.\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Jahn Dock in the Momoirent system."}
