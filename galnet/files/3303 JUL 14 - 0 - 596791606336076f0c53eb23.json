Hundreds of pilots contributed to the campaign by delivering construction materials to Blackmount Orbital in HIP 17692, and by eliminating agitators in the system so traders could deliver commodities in safety.\nIn a statement, the spokesperson said:\n“This new outpost will give us an excellent vantage point from which to monitor the Thargoids. Those who supported this initiative have our sincere gratitude.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Blackmount Orbital in the HIP 17692 system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:41:30Z","deprecated":false}
