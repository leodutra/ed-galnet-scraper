Hundreds of pilots responded to the organisation's request for rare foods and alcohol, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to the Norman–Mavis's Bingo Palace starport.\nThe organisation has also confirmed that its campaign to clear the Aramzahd system of agitators was equally successful, thanks to the many independent combat pilots who supported the operation. Those planning to attend the event will now be able to do so in safety.\nPilots who supported the campaigns are now free to collect their rewards from Norman–Mavis's Bingo Palace in the Aramzahd system.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:39:59Z","deprecated":false}
