Personnel at the site were constructing a portable fusion warhead codenamed the Lucifer Device.”\n“One operational prototype was produced, but we have failed to locate it. Our assumption is that whoever invaded the base now possesses a movable bomb with a 300 megaton yield – enough to destroy an entire city.”\n“This investigation is a top priority and we are exploring all available leads.”"}
