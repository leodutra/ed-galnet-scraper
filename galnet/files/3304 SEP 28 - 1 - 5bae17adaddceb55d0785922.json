Maddox Hurd and Scorpio DeVorrow, the heads of Herculean and Supratech respectively, both received enough materials to produce functional prototypes for the Rackham Ultratech Expo on Wednesday the 3rd of October.”\n“This expo is crucial for both companies. Rackham Capital Investments and other corporate sponsors will be paying close attention, and Zachary Rackham himself will be present, eager to get his hands on the latest gadgets.”\n“Both the customisable Duradrive and the wearable Torc have captured the public imagination, but the prototypes’ performance is key. The amount of commodities each company received might be the deciding factor in their commercial success.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:44:32Z","deprecated":false}
