Sap Core Legion believes that this detail makes Heike an ideal location for the new installation.\nProfessor Macklin Fox, speaking on behalf of Sap Core Legion, said:\n\"Sap Core Legion wishes to build this facility in response to a number of recent outbreaks and epidemics. When one also considers the current Thargoid conflict, we feel humanity would benefit from additional off-world medical resources.”\nIndependent pilots have been invited to deliver advanced medicines, thallium and medical diagnostic equipment to Braun Enterprise in the Heike system.\nThe initiative is scheduled to run from August 29th to September 4th 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:22:56Z","deprecated":false}
