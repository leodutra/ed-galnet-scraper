Through their dishonourable actions they seek to unravel the delicate threads that bind us together as a great and unified society.”\n“The house of Duval will not allow the madness of the few to undo everything that we have struggled so long to achieve. I swear to you, brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, the Emperor’s protection will stand. You will not live in fear of hunger, of sickness, of weakness or shame.”\n“Enemies of the Imperial court beware. This is your one warning. You will not get another.”"}
