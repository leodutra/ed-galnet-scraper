He was attempting to gain access to Hind Mine asteroid base, in search of evidence that Salvation’s anti-xeno weapon was deliberately designed to provoke the Thargoids.\nPatience Middleton, a spokesperson for Taurus Mining Ventures, made this announcement:\n“This was an illegal and unnecessary conflict, brought about by Admiral Tanner’s misguided obsession. We will continue working with Salvation to eliminate the Thargoid threat.”\n“Our defence was only possible thanks to our courageous supporters, for whom rewards are available at Hind Mine. We will also honour agreements that the Aegis Defense force made with independent pilots, who can collect their promised payments from the Musashi.”\nTaurus Mining Ventures later confirmed that all members of the Musashi’s original crew will be allowed to leave the megaship unharmed. Admiral Tanner and other key personnel are in temporary custody. Aegis has arranged for them to be transferred to its internal security teams.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:19:24Z","deprecated":false}
