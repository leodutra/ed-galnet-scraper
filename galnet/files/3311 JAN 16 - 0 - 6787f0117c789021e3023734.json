After the Proteus Wave weapon in the system in 3308, Thargoids aggressively swarmed the system until recently.\nBut AX forces sought to change this over the past few weeks, and the signal from Aegis’ military advisor Aden Tanner indicates that the system is now fully under human control. Tanner himself provided a message of thanks:\n“The impeccable efforts of AXI, XSF and allied AX pilots have finally brought peace to one more system. I only wish I was young enough to join these heroes out on the front lines. These pilots have provided a great service to humanity, and all here at Aegis salute them.”","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:39Z","deprecated":false}
