He has released this statement:\n“Thanks to many courageous Commanders, we have found several new Guardian sites and recovered a great deal of data. As I theorised, the ruins are not as dead as they seem, since some are actively defended by ancient Guardian drones.”\n“My analysis of the data has yielded key technological information, much of which can be put to immediate practical use. This has allowed me to produce blueprints for new weaponry and power-plant systems based on Guardian designs.”\n“I am currently liaising with technology brokers to manufacture and distribute these devices, which I hope will benefit the galaxy in these troubled times.”\nRam Tah added that he will continue to rely on the galactic community’s support in unearthing further knowledge about the Guardians.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:53:24Z","deprecated":false}
