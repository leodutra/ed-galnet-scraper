But the brave men and women of Ross 310 Natural Services are doing everything they can to prevent that from happening.”\nBoth organisations have issued calls for aid, appealing to independent combat pilots for support. Commanders who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction.\nBoth factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 29th of March 3304.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:23:29Z","deprecated":false}
