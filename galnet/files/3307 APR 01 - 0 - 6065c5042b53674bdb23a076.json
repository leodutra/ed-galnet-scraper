Their agents infiltrated other local factions to transport enzyme bombs to their targets.\nThe faction has now renamed itself the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid. Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, its leader, has declared a revolution against the Imperial Family. From his flagship, the Steel Majesty, he announced:\n“The corrupt Duvals will never give up their power, so we must take it from them. All those who seek to change the established order – join us!”\nThe Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group responded by engaging their forces in battle. Senator Denton Patreus has ordered them to “take revenge for the ‘Nine Martyrs’ atrocities.”\nThis is the first instance of a faction openly adopting Neo-Marlinism, although it has not been officially recognised by the Marlinist Colonies. Minister Aaron Whyte commented:\n“It’s a lost opportunity that Landgrave Delacroix chose to aid extremists, rather than provide a political platform to the Neo-Marlinist community. I hope we can soon replace the cycle of violence with meaningful communication.”","extractionDate":"2021-04-18T19:32:46Z","deprecated":false}
