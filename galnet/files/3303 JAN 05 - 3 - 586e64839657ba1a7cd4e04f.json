The Council has now launched a second initiative, once again giving the galaxy's minor factions an opportunity to establish a permanent presence in the Colonia Nebula.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the organisation said:\n\"We were delighted with the response to the first initiative, which demonstrated a clear commitment to the Colonia community.\"\n\"For this appeal, we are once again asking pilots to deliver a specific commodity to Jaques Station on behalf of their chosen organisation in order to earn a migration visa.\"\n\"At the end of the campaign, the ten factions that have made the largest contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the systems we have targeted for colonisation. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for the organisation's sole use.\"\nThe campaign begins on the 5th of January 3303 and will run for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:50:38Z","deprecated":false}
