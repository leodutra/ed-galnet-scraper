These figures date back nearly a thousand years and commemorate the early settlers of Eotienses agreeing to join the Empire.”\n“This morning, visitors found the entire exhibit empty, with every single one of the Candromir statues gone. Painted onto the wall was a graphic of a winking cat. The museum cannot explain how its security systems were so completely circumvented.”\nCaptain Madoc Evander of the Imperial Internal Security Service commented:\n“We are performing forensic analyses and interviewing all staff and visitors. As yet, we cannot confirm any connection between this theft and one that occurred three months ago in the Alioth system, despite the identical ‘winking cat’ motif. We will make every effort to capture this criminal and recover these precious cultural artefacts.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:55:13Z","deprecated":false}
