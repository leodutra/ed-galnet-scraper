This led to a cascading systems failure that shut down all of the station’s alignment thrusters.\nAs a result, the entire starport became affected by the gravity of Delphi 5 a, and began falling toward the moon. This immediately endangered the lives of tens of thousands of civilians. \nDue to fire damage in the docking bay and the narrow timescale, evacuation of The Oracle’s entire population before it impacted upon the surface was considered impossible.\nWith only hours to go before collision, independent pilots risked their lives to rescue thousands of trapped civilians from the falling and damaged starport. This allowed the engineers to focus on patching up The Oracle’s alignment systems. The station is now considered to be in a stable orbit.\nA spokesperson for Sirius Inc told the media:\n“We are immensely grateful to those courageous Commanders for helping to prevent what could have been one of the most horrific disasters in modern history.”\nSimilar incidents have been reported at other stations that were targeted by the Thargoids, leading to speculation that this may not be coincidental. Unilateral plans to shore up this vulnerability in the starports are now underway.","extractionDate":"2021-07-12T21:46:57Z","deprecated":false}
