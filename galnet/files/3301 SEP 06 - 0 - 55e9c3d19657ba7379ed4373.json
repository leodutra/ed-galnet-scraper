To commemorate his mother’s recent passing, the rights to register a planet in her name were purchased from Universal Cartography.\nCynthia Sideris, chairwoman of Universal Cartography, read a statement from the anonymous benefactor:\n“Commander Sataris has served with distinction, valour and honour in all his duties, regardless of the circumstances. In honour of his late mother, rights have been purchased to rechristen a world in the BD+26 2184 system as ‘Kathy McBrayer’. Any mother capable of rearing a son like Sataris is well deserving of such a memorial. Kathy is an example to us all.”\nCommander Sataris responded by saying: \"I invite all members of the Pilots Federation to visit the memorial planet Kathy McBrayer in BD+26 2184.”\nChairwoman Sideris said that Universal Cartography will finalize the change to the planet’s name in the coming weeks.\nCommander Corrigendum\nJameson Memorial Review | Interstellar Press","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:54:15Z","deprecated":false}
