The company with the most successful campaign will establish a new starport in the permit-controlled system.\nSenator Zemina Torval, who has sole control of the Mastopolos Mining subsidiary, announced:\n“My company is working on an experimental mining laser with increased range. To achieve this, shipments of mined resources must be delivered in sufficient numbers to the Pride of Bitterwood megaship in LTT 198.”\nEmmerich Koenig, CEO of Wreaken Construction, outlined a counter-initiative:\n“We will pay handsomely for deliveries of mined resources to the megaship Tobias’s Gift in the LTT 198 system.”\nBoth factions have requested units of coltan, gallite, praseodymium and silver.\nLTT 198 State Ltd will provide all contributors to these initiatives with temporary system permits lasting one week.","extractionDate":"2022-12-01T01:27:56Z","deprecated":false}
