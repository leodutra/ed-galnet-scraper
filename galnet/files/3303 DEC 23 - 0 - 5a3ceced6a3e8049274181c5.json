The attacks have resulted in significant damage and hundreds of casualties.\nAs with last week’s attacks, the strikes were executed by Interceptor Medusas – a particularly devastating class of Thargoid attack ship.\nAuthorities in the affected systems have entreated independent pilots to support relief operations by evacuating civilians from the affected starports. They have also appealed for food, water, basic medicines and natural fabrics."}
