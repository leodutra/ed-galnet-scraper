Although most turn out to be of no consequence, on this occasion I have identified three energy signatures that I believe warrant further investigation.”\n“The signals originate from the NGC 2451A sector, the IC 2391 sector and the Synuefe EN-H region. I have no further data, and at this time the signatures’ meaning remains a mystery.”\n“I encourage any independent pilots operating in these regions to investigate. I do of course apologise if this turns out to be a pointless exercise, but in the pursuit of scientific knowledge, even the smallest opportunity must be explored.”","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:04:34Z","deprecated":false}
