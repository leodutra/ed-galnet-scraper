Figures from the worlds of politics, commerce and culture are scheduled to convene at KatherineB for what is promised to be \"an event of unparalleled opulence\".\nWith the event scheduled to take place next week, the Zeus Bureau has placed an open order for a range of luxury goods, promising to reward those who deliver these commodities to KatherineB in the Zeus system.\nA spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement:\n\"Some of the most powerful people in the galaxy will attend this event, so it is of the utmost importance that our guests want for nothing. We have therefore placed open orders for Giant Irukama Snails, Kamitra Cigars and Lavian Brandy. We are confident that, with the support of the galactic community, we can create a truly memorable event.\"\nThe appeal begins on 18th of May 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T01:58:12Z","deprecated":false}
