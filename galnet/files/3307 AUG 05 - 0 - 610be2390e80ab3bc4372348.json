President Zachary Hudson made a brief public announcement:\n“I call upon all Federal auxiliaries to aid in this conflict. The reputation of the Federation cannot be so easily tarnished by such criminal action.”\nGovernor Sonal Mishra, the leader of New Kuwembaa Labour, also requested assistance:\n“The Federal Accord is no longer fit for purpose. We require support to make a stand against this violation of our constitutional rights.”\nThree other Federal factions are about to declare themselves as independent sovereign states: Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party and Mutumu Future. These control a combined total of 28 systems.\nHowever, two recently seceded factions – the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour – are considering rejoining the Federation, depending on the result of the Kuwembaa conflict.\nPro-independence pilots can support New Kuwembaa Labour by delivering combat bonds to Gagnan Port station. Federal auxiliaries can fight on behalf of Li Chotep for Equality by handing in combat bonds at the Fortress Liberty megaship.","extractionDate":"2021-08-09T17:34:02Z","deprecated":false}
