In a statement, a spokesperson for the organisation said:\n\"Okinura has been marked for development due to its strategically significant position between the systems of Federal President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters. By transforming Okinura into a high-tech system we hope to create a valuable trading hub and give a boost to the wider Federal economy.\"\nIn support of this goal, the Earth Defence Fleet has devised a two-pronged strategy, placing an open order for polymers with which to upgrade Fisher Terminal, and setting aside privateer bonds for combat pilots who help to eliminate agitators operating in Okinura.\nThe initiative begins today and will run for one week.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T01:55:59Z","deprecated":false}
