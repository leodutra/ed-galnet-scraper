The amount of materials received will determine exactly how many outposts are built.\nThe Junkyard Dogs have promised to reward pilots who deliver tantalum, power generators and silver to their base of operations at Tolagarfâ€™s Junkyard.\nThe campaign begins on the 22nd of June 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:39:05Z","deprecated":false}
