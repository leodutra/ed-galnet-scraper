These will allow construction of a megaship from which the organisation will broadcast its take on current events.\nAlessandra Koa of Broadcast Cobra issued the following statement:\n“We'd like to thank everyone who supported this campaign. We hope that wherever you are, you're always listening.”\nPilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Sopwith Dock in the HIP 16038 system.","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:25:25Z","deprecated":false}
