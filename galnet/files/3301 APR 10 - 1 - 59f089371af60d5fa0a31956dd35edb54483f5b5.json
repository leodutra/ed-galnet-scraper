Fortunately the ex-assassin was persuaded to divulge the name of the organisation that tasked them with the attempt.”\n“Members of the Imperial Court were dispatched to investigate the matter in more detail, and thanks to work carried out by Count von Auerburg, Earl Rednam and Earl Khaelmin we now know where to concentrate our efforts on next.”\n“Have no fear loyal citizens. Even now the Princess is preparing to initiate the next stage of the investigation. The Princess will catch those responsible, and she will make them pay for their transgressions.”","extraction_date":"2021-03-22T02:21:07Z","deprecated":false}
