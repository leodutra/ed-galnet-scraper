Commander Nookie Mr.Smith took the number one spot on Thursday with a truly incredible 6 minute 43 second run, while Commanders Raijiin and Rewision are sitting comfortably in second and third place respectively.\nTwenty-three competitors have so far hurled their SRVs to the shipwreck and back, while at least five more are scheduled to take part.\nBut although hundreds of SRVs have raced over the wreckage, it continues to show no signs of life. A Buckyball spokesman said, \"Either it's dead or it's not a racing fan.\"\nThe race continues throughout next week."}
