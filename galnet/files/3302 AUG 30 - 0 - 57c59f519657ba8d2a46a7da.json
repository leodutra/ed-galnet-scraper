Consequently, we now need much smaller quantities of meta-alloys to return a malfunctioning starport to functionality â€“ half as much as we used to, in fact.\"\n\"We've also determined that the week immediately following the first signs of Unknown Artefact-related interference is a critical one. If an affected starport can be supplied with meta-alloys within that week, it is far less likely that the situation at the starport will worsen.\"","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:01:12Z","deprecated":false}
