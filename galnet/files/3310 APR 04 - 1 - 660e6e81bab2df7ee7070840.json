The data we are gathering from the collected materials is staggering, and our work has progressed at an astonishing rate. Our teams are hard at work getting the prototype ready for production as I speak, and we are eager to show you all the fruits of our labour very soon.\nSirius Corporation, the current sole manufacturer of Frame Shift Drives, was asked for comment on this research:\n“Sirius recognises Achilles’ claims of ‘revolutionising’ an extremely advanced technology in a relatively short span of time, but we remain unconvinced of their substance. If Achilles can produce something other than words we will be happy to comment further.”","extractionDate":"2025-01-28T03:38:58Z","deprecated":false}
