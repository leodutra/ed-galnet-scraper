A colossal influx of materials has enabled us to repair two stations in the core systems in record time.”\n“I’m pleased to announce that Armstrong Enterprise in the Bhal system and Beaufoy Vision in the Nauni system are now open for business. Keeping these starports operable allows us to honour those who lost their lives in the Thargoid attacks. Enormous thanks to everyone who participated.”\nSenior Engineer Lilith Galloway of Aegis Research, who coordinated a parallel project, released a similar statement:\n“Here in the Pleiades, survival is never guaranteed. But Reed's Rest in Merope has endured, thanks to the galactic community’s incredible support. This is what we do when things get tough – we rebuild and come back stronger.”\nAll three starports are now fully operational and providing a range of services."}
