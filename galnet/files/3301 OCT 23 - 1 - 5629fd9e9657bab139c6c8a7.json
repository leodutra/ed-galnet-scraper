According to Blake Fry, a commercial freight pilot who regularly traverses the 49 Arietis system, the starport of Gaiman Dock has been hit with a plethora of issues in recent hours, including power outages and system failures. Speaking to the Federal Times, Fry said:\n\"I don't know exactly what's going on, but they've got problems popping up all over the place. Energy, infrastructure â€“ everything's on the fritz. They're in a world of pain over there.\"\nWhen asked if he had any theories on what was happening at Gaiman Dock, Fry was unequivocal:\n\"Hey, I read the news. I'm not stupid. First they take those alien pods there, and then there's a complete technical breakdown. Didn't they say those AEO things damaged machinery? Join the dots, man!\"\nThe issues in 49 Arietis are not believed to be affecting station services at this time."}
