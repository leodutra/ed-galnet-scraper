Millions of credits' worth of insurance claims were issued as the Commanders of the XYZ Fight Club kicked off the 'Cobra Crunch'.\nOne of the most epic battles of the tournament was the fight between Koldnitz and FlappyHamWallet (both very experienced commanders), who lit up the skies around the Coriolis starport with their lasers and missiles. Much whooping and cheering was heard over comms chatter  for over four hours, after which many congratulatory messages were directed to Commander Estalath, who appeared to be the victor.\nStation security has confirmed that several thousand credits' worth of fines were issued, but there was no significant damage done to the station. One station worker reported: \"This old girl can withstand a few out-of-control Cobras crashing into her.\" Meanwhile, system authorities were reportedly unhappy about Athena hosting a second XYZ Fight Club event, saying: \"we thought they'd host one event and then move on\".\nCommander Amphetamine Rush","extractionDate":"2021-03-22T02:24:39Z","deprecated":false}
