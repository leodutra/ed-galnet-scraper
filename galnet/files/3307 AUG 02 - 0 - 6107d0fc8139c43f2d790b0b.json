Safeguard Interstellar is providing vital supplies to survivors, and evacuations of Stillman Hub and Tilman Point stations are ongoing.\nFirst Minister Jenna Fairfax has been confirmed dead. Minister Amrita Ross has temporarily assumed leadership, but the Marlinist Parliament has been destabilised by heated accusations between its members.\nThe Marlinist Constabulary has tightened security, and ACT is running urgent investigations. Captain Milo Castile told the media:\n“This was undoubtedly the work of Theta Group, the NMLA’s weapons specialists. We have found evidence that local Neo-Marlinist supporters provided logistical support, and arrests are forthcoming. However, as always the terrorists covered their tracks remarkably well.”\nAlliance and Federation leaders have sent messages of condolence and offers of medical aid. Prime Consul Kayode Tau is liaising with both superpowers to coordinate relief efforts.\nIn the Empire, from which the Marlinists fled as refugees in 3306, there are mixed reactions. Some wish to extend protection to former Imperial citizens, while others see it as poetic justice for their republican beliefs ‘creating’ the NMLA.","extractionDate":"2021-08-09T17:34:15Z","deprecated":false}
