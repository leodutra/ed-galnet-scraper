This included a Bank of Zaonce senior director, who illegally redirected funds to bankroll Kincaid’s re-election campaign.”\n“Kincaid’s ultimate aim was to transfer executive power from Alioth to Zaonce, establishing a base of support to eventually become the supreme ruler of the Alliance. But with such a detailed and damning testimony from Yamamoto, it seems impossible that his presidency can survive these revelations.”"}
