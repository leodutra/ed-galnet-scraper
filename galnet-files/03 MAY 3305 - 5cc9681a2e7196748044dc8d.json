He has a stable home life on the station with a wife and three children, with no criminal record.”\n“Although Romero’s job gave him access to landing pads, it does not explain his ability to bypass ship security protocols or launch without authorisation. We have yet to determine his motive or destination.”\n“The scope of our investigation is widening and we hope to know more soon.”"}
