Concerns were originally raised by Adley King of The Federal Times, as part of an investigation into weapons testing within inhabited sectors.\nCEO Lucina Prax gave this press statement:\n“I can assure Ms King that my company takes every precaution when evaluating its products. We have never – and will never – ignore safety protocols.”\n“Regarding these accusations, I am aware of the claims being made but have yet to see a single shred of evidence to support them. We act in full compliance with the most stringent industry regulations.”\n“3304 was a record year for Prax Incorporated. The latest version of our proprietary threat-recognition firmware propelled our stock to new heights, and we are developing a new system that I believe will be considered revolutionary.”"}
