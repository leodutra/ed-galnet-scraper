As they have refused to cooperate, a state of war has been declared until she is surrendered to our custody.”\n“Our affiliate faction, the Keltim Empire League, has requested the support of independent pilots against any resisting anarchist forces.”\nAna Westergard, a spokesperson for the Eurybia Blue Mafia, broadcast this emergency message:\n“This is an outrageous invasion by the Empire! We categorically deny any involvement with the NMLA. I urgently call upon our supporters – and anyone who cares about freedom – to help us defend Liz Ryder as well as our independence.”\nEngineering services are still available at the Demolition Unlimited workshop, with Liz Ryder communicating remotely from a place of safety."}
