As a result, search-and-rescue initiatives have been neglected, but we are determined to plug that gap. That means a lot of civilians rescued from escape pods, which also means a lot of hungry mouths to feed, so we’ll need to bolster our current food stocks as a precautionary measure.”\nPilots are requested to recover occupied escape pods and damaged escape pods. In addition, the following food resources are also required: fruit and vegetables, grain and food cartridges. Both recovered pods and food stocks should be delivered to Donar's Oak in the Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 system.\nThe campaign begins on the 9th of August 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
