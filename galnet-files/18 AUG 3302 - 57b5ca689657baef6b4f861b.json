Reports indicate that the agitators are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing discord.\nTo counter this threat, Arque Commodities has placed a kill order on all wanted ships operating in the system, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Austen Town Station.\nThe campaign begins on the 18th of August 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
