The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.\nHere are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:\nBrotherhood of LP 98-132\nLHS 535 Silver United Ltd\nLeague of Ross 1015\nAlacha Purple Society\nDragons of Neche\nVesuvit Galactic Industries\nEtznabal Silver Boys \nComanga Crimson Crew\nAndhi Liberals\nProgressive Party of Wolf 433\nWhen a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished.
