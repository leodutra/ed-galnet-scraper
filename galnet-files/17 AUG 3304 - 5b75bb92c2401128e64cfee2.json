Reports indicate that these felons are attacking pilots travelling in the system, disrupting trade and generally causing mayhem.\nTo counter this threat, Kamici Incorporated has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Gaiman Port.\nThe campaign begins on 16th of August 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately."}
