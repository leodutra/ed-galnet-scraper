Several megaships were intercepted while attempting to transport large numbers of Marlinist civilians out of the Ackwada system.\nThis report was delivered by the Imperial Internal Security Service:\n“We have taken many Marlinist criminals into custody, despite their efforts to shield the terrorists. Some may have temporarily evaded us, but we are confident that we can track and destroy the NMLA cells operating within this system.”\n“Our affiliate, the Regulatory State of Ackwada, will distribute rewards at Glorious Destiny to all who contributed to this victory.”\nThe Duduseklis Empire League broadcast this message to its supporters:\n“Thousands of political refugees attempted to flee from persecution onboard megaships. Unfortunately, the Imperial blockade was supported by too many independent pilots, and none were able to escape.”\n“Despite being unable to help our Marlinist supporters, we are still able to offer rewards at Rush's Camp for the brave few who dared to dream of democracy.”\nImperial scouts are currently searching for many smaller vessels that fled the system and may contain NMLA activists."}
