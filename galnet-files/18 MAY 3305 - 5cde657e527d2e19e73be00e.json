Admiral Yamamoto is known to be a personal friend to Kincaid, from the latter’s time as governor of Zaonce.”\n“The Council of Admirals has demanded that Yamamoto rescinds this decree. Admiral Rachel Ziegler condemned the decision as ‘political grandstanding that borders on treason’.”\nWhile President Kincaid has accepted the authority, he has yet to issue any orders to the ADF fleet stationed in Zaonce."}
